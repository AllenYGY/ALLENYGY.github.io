 <br><br>Syntax analysis is the second phase of a compiler.<br>
<br>Take a stream of tokens from the lexer as input.
<br>Analyze the structure of the tokens.
<br>Detect syntax errors.
<br>Out put a parsing tree to present the structure.
<br>Use context-free grammar (CFG) for analysis.<br><br>Why CFG?

<br>CFG is more powerful than regular expressions.
<br>CFGs are not the most powerful formal language (see Chomsky hierarchy),
<br>but CFGs are enough to describe the structures for most of the languages.

<br><br>Context free grammar
A Context free grammar is a , where

<br> is a finite set called Variables
<br> is a finite set, disjoint from , called the terminals,
<br> is a finite set of production rules, with each rule being a variable  and a string  of  variables and terminals in the form , and
<br> is the start variable.

<br>The production rules are same as the rules in the regular definition.<br>We can use the rules to derive the strings in a context-free language.<br>Terminals are the symbols which cannot produce more symbols. In a compiler, they are tokens.<br>Variables only exists when the production is unfinished.<br>
They are not symbols in the alphabet, neither tokens. Thus, they are not in the strings of the language.<br><br>For example,<br>
<br> Variables
<br> Terminals
<br>
<br>
<br>The production rules can also be "combined" and rewritten as<br>
<br><br>
The symbol "|" is same as it is in regular expressions, meaning that there are multiple options.
<br>The rules can be combined only if the LHS are the same.<br>
Sometimes the set of production rules is enough to define a grammar because<br>
<br>Variables can be obtained by looking at the LHS of each production rule,
<br>Terminals are the symbols on the RHS of the rules excluding the variables, and
<br>The start symbol is usually denoted by .
<br>Then, the above grammar can be<br><br><br>Derivations
Given a grammar , we can generate strings in the language  by using a derivation.<br>
A derivation (informally) is a procedure to apply the production rules from the start symbol to a string which only contains terminals.
<br>Each production is denoted by .<br>For example, given the grammar<br><br>left-most derivation, meaning that each iteration we replace the left most nonterminal.<br><br><br>Similarly, the right-most derivation replaces the right most nonterminal in each iteration.<br><br>Each sequence of nonterminals and tokens that we derive at each step is called a sentential form.<br>
<br>
The last sentential form only contains tokens and is called a sentence, which is a syntactically correct string in the programming language.

<br>
If  is a sentence and  is the start symbol, we can write<br>


<br>
 means derive in zero or more steps. It also means the RHS is derivable by the LHS.

<br>
From the above example,<br>


<br><br>The grammar  is ambiguous if there is a sentence in  from which it is possible to construct multiple parse trees (using any type of derivation).<br><br>Some properties

<br>Each derivation (left-most, right-most, or otherwise) corresponds to exactly one parse tree, whether the grammar is ambiguous or not.
<br>每个推导（无论是最左推导、最右推导或其他推导）对应唯一一个语法树，无论语法是否有歧义。
<br>Each parse tree corresponds to multiple derivations, whether the grammar is ambiguous or not.<br>
每个语法树可以对应多个推导，无论语法是否有歧义。
<br>Each parse tree corresponds to exactly one left-most derivation and exactly one right-most derivation, whether the grammar is ambiguous or not.<br>
每个语法树对应唯一的最左推导和最右推导。
<br>All derivations of the same sentence correspond to the same parse tree if the grammar is not ambiguous.<br>
如果语法没有歧义，同一语句的所有推导对应相同的语法树。
<br>Multiple derivations of the same sentence may not correspond to the same parse tree if the grammar is ambiguous.<br>
如果语法没有歧义，同一语句的所有推导对应相同的语法树。
<br>In general, deciding a grammar is ambiguous or not is undecidable, or uncomputable (like the halting problem).
<br>一般来说，判断一个语法是否有歧义是不可判定或不可计算的。

<br><br>A compiler cannot use an ambiguous grammar because each input program must be parsed to a unique parse tree to show the structure.<br>To remove ambiguity in a grammar, we can transform it by hand into an unambiguous grammar.<br>
This method is possible in theory but not widely used in practical because of the difficulty.<br>Most compilers use additional information to avoid ambiguity.<br><br><br><br>
<br>
To prove a language is not context-free, you need pumping lemma for context free languages.

<br>
To powerup the CFG/PDA, we can try again to add another stack to the machine, same as what we did to finite automata.

<br>
This upgrade is ultimate. A finite automata with two stacks is as powerful as a Turing machine, which is the most powerful computational model that human can implement right now.

<br><br>Intuitively, a PDA is a finite automata plus a stack with some modifications on the transitions to fit stack behaviors.<br>
<br>An NPDA is (formally) a 6-tuple , where

<br> is a finite set of states,
<br> is a finite set of the input alphabet,
<br> is a finite set of the stack alphabet,
<br> is the transition function,
<br> is the start state, and
<br> is the set of accept states.


<br>For example, the context-free language  has grammar<br><br><br><br>
<br>
Now, we want to implement a parser which

<br>takes a sequence of tokens as input;
<br>analyze the structure of the input;
<br>generates a parse tree; and
<br>indicates the syntax errors if there is any.


<br>
There are two types of parsers:

<br>top-down
<br>bottom-up.


<br>Top-down parsing tries to construct a sequence of tokens from the grammar which is same as the input.<br>
Bottom-up parsing tries to match the input tokens with grammar rules.<br><br>Top-down parsing is only for a subset of context-free grammars.<br>
<br>
Top-down parsing means that we generate the parse tree from top to bottom.

<br>
Remember that the internal vertices in a parse tree are the nonterminals (variables), while the leaves are the terminals (tokens).

<br>
The parse tree construction depends on the production rules in the grammar.

<br>
If we want to construct the parse tree from top to bottom, the production rules have to be nicely designed.

<br><br>The RHS of each production rule always starts from a different terminal. 	<br>
The parsing on the left branch always finishes before the right branch.<br>For example, the following grammar parses single variable declarations (if we do not care about types here).<br><br><br>Suppose the input is .<br>
The input tokens can be uniquely parsed into<br><br><br>However, our life cannot be that easy in most of cases.<br>
<br>The previous grammar does not allow multiple variable declarations in one statement.
<br>So, consider this grammar.<br><br><br>and try to parse <br>We have two different choices for the first derivation.<br><br>We cannot decide which production rule can be used for the derivation.<br>
The parser will pick a valid rule randomly.<br>If the guess is wrong, the parser cannot proceed parsing on some input tokens and it will backtrack.<br>Actually, you have seen backtracking in other places … Depth First Search.<br>We can express the parsing by using a DFS tree.<br>
<br>Each vertex in the tree is a valid sentential form (a stream of terminals and nonterminals). In this example, the stream to the RHS of  , given by a step number .
<br>Each edge is defined by applying a production rule.
<br>The minor difference here is that we don’t need to go back to the root (as DFS) when the parsing is finished.<br>Note that this DFS is different from the parse tree because a vertex presents a sentential form, which is equivalent to a (partial) parse tree.<br><img alt="DFS" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/yDXF14.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Each nonterminal  is implemented by an individual function.<br>
<br>Iterate on every rule starts with  on LHS.
<br>Remember to resume the tokens when derivation fails.
<br><img alt="Implementation" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/VM6ClD.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>The parse tree generation can be done at Row 4 and Row 6, when the algorithm continues parsing.<br>You can also record the derivation rules and generate the parse tree when parsing is finished.<br>Resuming the parsed tokens at Row 9 can be implemented by a stack. When a token is matched with a terminal, push the token into the stack. When error occurs, we pop the tokens and put them back to the input.<br>The main routine starts from matching the start variable.<br>The parser reports syntax error when the main routine has tried all possible production rules. A syntax error can be<br>
<br>the parser receives a token which cannot be parsed;
<br>after processing all tokens, the parse is incomplete (some leaves are nonterminals); or
<br>when the parsing is complete (all leaves are terminals), there are some tokens remained in the input.
<br><br>
<br>The implementation (in code) can be very complicated/ugly because it needs to try many production rules, imaging many try-catch scopes nested with each other.
<br>It waste a lot of time on backtracking.
<br>It needs additional space to store the tokens for resuming purpose.
<br>In practical, nobody uses recursive descent parser.
<br><br><br>To avoid backtracking, we want to design a parser which can guess the next token from the input.<br>A correct guess can let the parser uniquely choose a production rule for parsing.<br>The idea is using a temporary space to store some tokens in advanced, like a buffer. Then, use the buffered tokens to make decisions.<br>This technique is very similar to space-time trade-off in the dynamic programming, what we have learned in algorithms.<br>The time complexity of recursions with backtracking can go up to .<br>But, if we can choose rules uniquely, the time complexity becomes .<br><br>Consider the grammar<br><br><br><br>which is equivalent to the above one and try to parse <br>
<br>
In the first iteration, the parser has to use the rule .

<br>
In the second iteration, there are two production rules "" or " "

<br>
This uncertainty can be easily solved by just “looking” at the next token from the lexer. This token is called lookahead token.

<br>
Normally, when lexer returns a token to parser, the token is consumed. But the lookahead token remains in the input.

<br>
The lookahead token in this example is " ". So, the parser knows the rule is .

<br>Because the parser reads tokens from left to right, does leftmost derivation, and looks at most one lookahead token(could not be a non-terminal); this parser/grammar is called  .<br>Some grammars may not be  .<br>
<br>For example, the one we have seen.
<br><br>
<br>
Looking one token ahead is insufficient for this grammar.

<br>
 ; and  ,  agree on the first token.

<br>
If the lookahead token is “”, we cannot decide which rule will be used. Thus, to parse this grammar without recursions, the parser needs to look 2 tokens ahead.

<br>This is  grammar.


<br>In general, we can design  grammar, for constant .<br>In practical, more lookahead tokens make no big differences but increase the implementation difficulties.<br>More importantly,   grammar is already powerful enough.<br><br>Left-factoring is a grammar transformation to convert a grammar to  .<br>Back to the example,<br><br>is not  because the first token of the two rules are the same.

Obviously, this is wrong.<br>The problem is cause by .$ The RHS starts from a nonterminal, which cannot be used to match with a lookahead token.<br>This type of grammar is called left recursive.<br>Note that this still left-most derivation. Left-most or right-most derivation is not related to grammar itself. It only relates to in which order we derive the nonterminals.<br>Formally, a left recursive grammar has a valid derivation  ,<br>

<br>For example, the one we used to show ambiguity elimination
<br><br><br><br>After left factoring  becomes<br><br><br>Here are some last words about (recursive) predictive parsers.<br>
<br>A predictive parser can always correctly predict what it has to do next.
<br>Predictive parsers can always be implemented by a recursive parser without using lookahead tokens.
<br>Without further specification, we consider recursive parsers and predictive parsers are the same.
<br>One major disadvantages of (recursive) predictive parsers is that they are not very efficient in implementations. Each production rule is implemented as a function. The parser needs to make many function calls and returns, which consume a lot of resources.
<br>To avoid the function calls, we introduce nonrecursive predictive parsers.<br><br>To avoid recursions, we introduce non-recursive predictive parsers.<br>Intuitively, predictions are required when a nonterminal has multiple production rules.<br>The predictions are based on the next token. One token is enough because we are parsing  grammars.<br>However, this method has troubles when the RHS of some rules start with nonterminals.<br>
<br>For example
<br><br><br><br>
<br>We cannot decide whether we are going to use  or 𝐴 without looking at  and .
<br>Thus, we can "preprocess" the grammar to find the first tokens derived by each nonterminal before parsing the tokens.<br>The result of preprocessing is presented by a table, called parsing table.<br>
The rows are the nonterminals and the columns are terminals.<br>
The entry  is a production rule  meaning that if the input token is , we will apply the rule .<br>
The parser can parse the input tokens by checking the parsing table and using a stack.<br>This method is similar to the push-down automata but presented differently.<br>
<br>Initially, push $ and  into the stack ( on top of $ ) where  is the first nonterminal.<br>
Also insert $ to the end of the input stream of tokens.
<br><br>
<br>
In each iteration,

<br>Assume the next input token is ;
<br>Pop the first item from the stack denoted by ;
<br>If  is a terminal, then try to match it with the next input token ;
<br>If  is a nonterminal, then  in the parsing table is a production rule, denoted by . Then, push everything in  to stack from right to left.


<br>
When the stack pops $ and all input tokens are consumed, the parsing halts.

<br>
$ is an artificial token, means the end of the stream.

<br><br>Given the parsing table and try to parse<br><br><br><br>Some entries  in the parsing table are empty.<br>Meaning that id you try to parse the token  by a nonterminal , the parser returns an error message.<br>For example, assume the input tokens are , the parsing will be stuck somewhere in the middle.<br>The error handling will be discussed at the end.<br>Intuitively, a parsing table enumerates all possible tokens can be derived by a nonterminal.<br>When a parser reads a token from input, it has a unique production rule to apply.<br>Thus, we need to analyze the grammar and find the prefix (the first token) of all possible sentential form derived by each nonterminal.<br><br>By putting all the firstly produced tokens into a set, we defined  .<br>
<br>For example,
<br><br><br>
<br> because 
<br> because .
<br> because .
<br>  because .
<br>Formally,  for each grammar symbol is computed by<br><img alt="Find_First" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/KoP6hF.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Note: each  on line 3-5 can be either a terminal or a nonterminal.<br><br>When a terminal produces , things get complicated.<br>

<br>However,  is not an input token which can be used for making predictions.<br>To handle this case, we also define , the next token possibly derived by some rules after .<br>
<br>
In this example,  because .

<br>
When the parser receives  as the next token, it knows  is the correct rule.

<br><img alt="Find_Follow" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/BtR5ed.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>Recall the parsing table  is , where  is the number of nonterminals and  is the number of terminals.<br>The entry  is a production rule that the parser will apply when the current nonterminal is 𝐴 and the next token is .<br>For each production  in the (left factored, non-left recursive) grammar, do the following:<br>

<br>compute the  sets for all nonterminals, and
<br>use those  and  sets to construct the parsing table.
<br><br><br>Back to the example in Top-Down Parsing. The following grammar is left-recursive.<br><br><br>Thus, top-down parsing needs to eliminate left recursion first.<br><br><br><br>However, the conversion changes the structure of some sentences, like .<br><br><br>Bottom-up parsing is more natural to human.<br>Think about how we analyze the arithmetic expressions.<br>
First, we calculate the subexpression in parentheses or the operator of the highest precedence.<br>
Then, the intermediate result will involve in the following calculations.<br>
The procedure is not from left to right.<br>Same thing happens when we analyze sentences in a program.<br>To the parse tree construction, the bottom-up procedure starts from isolated leaves, merges some of them to form a subtree, and eventually constructs the entire tree by placing a root.<br>The parse tree generated by bottom-up has no difference with by top-down, the internal vertices are nonterminals and leaves are tokens.<br>In fact, you have seen the similar procedure in Algorithm – the construction of Huffman code.<br>Because the bottom-up parsing is an inverse of top-down paring, the basic strategy is to use the LHS of some production rules to replace the RHS after reading some input tokens.<br>Thus, in the bottom-up parsing, there are two basic operations.<br>
<br>Shift

<br>The parser needs to read more tokens from the input.
<br>The tokens have already read are insufficient for any production rule.


<br>Reduce

<br>The parser has already read enough tokens.
<br>It can replace the RHS by the LHS of some production rules.


<br>The parser is called shift-reduce parser.<br>The parser also needs a stack to hold the tokens which are read but not consumed (reduced) yet.<br><br>
<br>Let’s look at a small example first. Given the following grammar and try to parse .
<br><br><br><br><br><br>The above example shows how bottom-up parsing works on a small instance.<br>However, to formally define a bottom-up parser, we need to generalize this procedure to all grammars. Many details will be discussed.<br>Even within this small example, careful reader may find the above procedure has some problems.<br>
In Step2, we read b. Then, we immediately reduce 𝑏 to A in Step3.<br>
But the thing is different in Step4. We read b again, but the parser waits until it reads another c and reduces Abc to A.<br>In general, similar to the predictive parser, there might be multiple options in bottom-up parsing. We need to clearly define which option is used under a certain condition.<br><br><br>There are many different ways to solve the above problem, like using recursions (Same as what we did in the predictive parsing, recursions simply enumerate all possible options.)<br>In this course, we only introduce  parsers (k lookahead tokens, LR parser for short) because<br>
<br> parsers can be used to almost all (but not all) context-free grammars.
<br>They are the most powerful non-backtracking shift-reduce parsers;
<br>they can be implemented very efficiently; and
<br>they are strictly more powerful than  grammars.
<br>When a reduction is performed, the  of the production rule is already on the stack, which is some additional information to help decision making.<br>The parser puts state symbols into the stack to speedup checking the content on the stack.<br>Imaging that you want to check what’s on the given stack. You need to pop everything out, see if the content is same as what you want, then push everything back. This is very inefficient.<br>Thus, we use a state symbol to indicate the current content on the stack.<br>This symbol is called state symbol because it is exactly same the states in a DFA.<br>We can consider each state in a DFA means that "To reach this state, the input must be some specific strings."<br>Also, each  is corresponds to an , like a pair.<br>To parse a  grammar, you are also given a parsing table.<br>
This parsing table again enumerates the actions the parser needs to take in all possible situations.<br>Each row in the table represents a state in PDA.<br>
The columns are split into two individual fields: ACTION and GOTO.<br>
<br>Each column in ACTION represents a terminal.
<br>Each column in GOTO represents a nonterminal.
<br>The value of the entry ACTION  shows the action taken by the parser when the current state is  and the input token is 
<br>The value are of two types:

<br> , meaning that the parser pushes the next input token into the stack and move to the state ;
<br>, meaning that the parser reduces some (non)terminals using the production rule .


<br>The value of the entry  is a state symbol,  for example, meaning that the parser goes to the state  after it reduces the stack uses a production rule , for some .
<br>LR Parsing Algorithm

<br>Put the special symbol $ at the end of the input.
<br>Put state 0 at the bottom of the stack.
<br>In each iteration, suppose the current configuration is , the current state is , and the next input token is .

<br>If  is "shift S", then the next configuration is .	
<br>If  is "reduce ", then the next configuration is , where  and . At the same time, the parser outputs .
<br>If   is "accept" and the current configuration is  , where  is the start symbol of the grammar, the parser accepts the input.
<br>For all other cases, like   is blank, the parser finds a syntax error and switch to error recovery.



<br><br><br><br><br>Previously, we have introduced the  parsing algorithm using the parsing table.<br>
Now, the question is how to construct a parsing table for a given context-free grammar.<br>In fact, there are many ways to construct a parsing table for different 𝐿𝑅 parsers:<br>, ,,  etc. (by increasing power).<br>For  with  are not used in practice because of the complexity.<br>We will focus on  (simple ), then move on to  ,   , and  .<br><br>To construct an  parsing table, we do three things<br>
<br>augment the context-free grammar;
<br>construct a DFA based on the computation of set of items;
<br>represent the DFA using the transition table;
<br>The construction in  is very similar to transforming an NFA to a DFA, except that it will be based on sets of items of the same behavior instead of sets of NFA states.<br><br>Given a grammar with a start symbol .<br><br><br>we construct the corresponding augmented grammar by artificially introducing a nonterminal  and a production rule.<br><br><br><br>This artificial production rule seems to be useless, but it guarantees that the parser accepts the input when it reduces using .<br><br>The  items are originally defined for   parser, but do the same thing in  .<br>An  item (item, for short)is simply a grammar production with a dot somewhere in its RHS.<br>
<br>For example, the production  can create 4 items 
<br><br><br><br><br>As a special case, the production  only generates <br>Each item represents a state that the parser is currently in.<br>
If the parser is in the state corresponding to , it means the parser has already push  into the stack and expects to match  from the input.<br>If  is a nonterminal and the grammar also has a production , then the parser also expects to see .<br>Thus, the parser state corresponds to  correspond .<br><br>Keep this intuition in mind, we find the closure of a set of items  recursively using the following algorithm.<br>
<br>
Every item in  is in .

<br>
If  is an item in  and if  is a production, where  and  are nonterminals and ,  , and  are any sequence of terminals and nonterminals, then add the item  to .

<br>
Repeat the above two steps until  does not change.

<br>
For example,

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Then, we define  function.<br>For all the items of the form  in a set of items , where  is an arbitrary grammar symbol (token or nonterminal), we define  as the closure of the set of items of the form .<br>
<br>
For example, given the set of items , to find :

<br>the item  does not create any new item by taking "+";
<br>the item  implies the new item 


<br>
Thus,

<br><br><br>更新时，当一个token 时non-terminal 时，继续传递<br><br><br>Next, we construct the DFA to decide the tokens in the stack.<br>
This method is called set-of-items construction algorithm.<br>
Each set of items  represents a state in the DFA.<br>
<br>Compute  and add the unmarked  to ,  where  is the start symbol of the augmented grammar and  is the set of DFA states.
<br>While there is an unmarked DFA state , do the following:

<br>For each grammar symbol , do the following:

<br>Compute the DFA state .
<br>If  and  then add the unmarked  to .
<br>If  then define .

More interestingly, a state, together with the string to reach the state, form a pair in the configuration.<br><br><br>First, we construct the  part of a  parsing table.<br>
<br>If  (where  is a token) is an item in the set of items  and , then set  to "shift j".
<br>If  is an item in the set of items , then set  to "reduce " for all  in .
<br>If  (where S' is the start symbol of the augmented grammar) is an item in the set of items , then set  to accept.
<br>For item 2, we give a number to each grammar production  and put in the table "reduce" followed by the production's number.<br>Then, we construction the  part.<br>
<br>If , where  is a nonterminal, then set  to ""
<br><br>Here are the steps to create a parsing table for an  parser:<br>
<br>Eliminate any ambiguity from the grammar.

<br>Eliminate left recursion from the grammar.
<br>Left factor the grammar.


<br>Augment the grammar with a new start symbol. 
<br>Compute the sets of items for the grammar and build the corresponding DFA.
<br>Number the grammar productions.
<br>Compute the  sets for all tokens and nonterminals.
<br>Compute the  sets for all nonterminals.
<br>Use the sets of items, DFA, and the  sets to construct the parsing table.
<br><br><br><br>In fact,  cannot avoid  conflict entirely. <br>Consider the following ambiguous grammar.<br><br>Construct the set of items <br><br><br><br><br>In addition,  contains the token ‘ = ’.<br>Thus, the parsing table construction algorithm will put both =  and  into the entry 𝐴𝐶𝑇𝐼𝑂𝑁 [2 , ] , which is conflict.<br>Sometimes, when current state is , next token is "=", parser does not reduce <br><br><br><br>To eliminate the conflict, we analyze the above grammar.<br>Then, we can see reduce(R → L) is not supposed to be performed in all the cases when the next input token is in FOLLOW(R).<br>
<br>If L appears on the LHS of =, reduce(R → L) is only needed when there is a * before L.
<br>And if an L is on the RHS of =, this specific L can only be followed by $, but not =.
<br>For example, if the input is * id = id, the parsing is as follows:<br>
<br>· * id = id → shift
<br>* · id = id → shift
<br>* id · = id → shift
<br>* L · = id → reduce(L → id)
<br>* R · = id → reduce(R → L) (highlighted in red)
<br>L · = id → reduce(L → * R)
<br>L = · id → shift
<br>L = id · → shift
<br>L = L · → reduce(L → id)
<br>L = R · → reduce(L → R) (highlighted in red)
<br>S · → reduce(S → L = R)

 <br><br>Compiler Definition
A compiler is a program that reads a program written in one programming language (the source language) and translates it into an equivalent program in another programming language (the target language).
<br><img alt="Compiler" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/b5MFWx.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>Input: source program
<br>Source Code Analysis (front end)
<br>Intermediate Code Generator 中间代码发生器
<br>Synthesis (back end) Output: target program
<br><br>Analysis comes in three phases:<br>
<br>Lexical analysis
<br>Syntax analysis
<br>Semantic analysis
<br><img alt="Analysis" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/P0lnxo.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>The program does lexical analysis is called lexer or scanner.<br>
<br>Reads the input program character by character as a stream.
<br>Splits the stream into lexemes, means “lexical elements”.
<br>Classifies each lexeme into a category of lexemes, called token.
<br>We use regular expressions to do lexical analysis.<br>Example<br>num=1+23;
<br><br><br>Here is a list of common tokens:<br>
<br>identifier: names the programmer chooses, like variable names; 变量名
<br>keywords: names already in the programming language, like if;关键字
<br>separator: punctuation characters and paired-delimiters, like {};
<br>operator: symbols operate on arguments and produce results, like +;
<br>literal: numeric, logical, textual, reference literals, like true, 123;字面量
<br>comment
<br><br>The program which does syntax analysis is called a parser.<br>
<br>Uses a grammar to analyze the form of tokens.
<br>And groups the tokens into a nested hierarchical structure.

<br>The structure is called a parse tree.


<br>The parse tree shows the structure of the program.
<br>Internal vertices are called non-terminals. Leaves are called terminals.
<br>Same as using English grammar to check if the nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., in a sentence are in the correct order.<br>Sometimes the parse tree can be extremely large.<br>
<br>To simplify the structure, we can remove the internal vertices and let the operators be the parents.
<br>This is called syntax tree.
<br><br>
<br>It takes a parse tree as input.
<br>Checks the “meaning” of the program.
<br>Searching errors in the program.

<br>For example,
<br>undefined variables,
<br>uninitialized variables,
<br>multiple declaration,
<br>types of variables for operations and functions, etc.


<br>Semantic Analysis also does type conversions for many programming languages.<br>float x=3.5;
int y=x;
<br>the compiler adds a type conversion on  before signing the value to  .<br><br><br><br>]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/compiler-construction/lecture/01-compiler-introduction.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Compiler Construction/Lecture/01-Compiler Introduction.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 05:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/b5MFWx.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/b5MFWx.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DCN-Assignment1]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>What is the OSI model?<br><br> There are 7 layers in the in OSI Model<br>
<br>Physical Layer

<br>It is concerned with transmitting raw bits over a communication channel.


<br>Data Link Layer

<br>It is to transform a raw transmission facility into a line that appears free of undetected transmission errors to the network layer.


<br>Network Layer

<br>It controls the operation of the subnet.


<br>Transport Layer

<br>It is to accept data from above, split it up into smaller units if need be, pass these to the network layer, and ensure that the pieces all arrive correctly at the other hand.


<br>Session Layer

<br>It allows users on different machines to establish sessions between them.


<br>Presentation Layer

<br>It is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information transmitted.


<br>Application Layer

<br>It contains a variety of protocols that are commonly needed by users, such as HTTP, Email, etc.


<br><br>There are no Session Layer and Presentation Layer in TCP/IP models<br><br>A company’s computer network is the backbone of its business as it connects all its computers and related devices, allowing staff to work more efficiently across the organization. Suppose a commercial company has about 8000 staff. As a computer officer in the company, you are required to design a computer network for that company. Note that network design involves evaluating and understanding how all the elements of the network link together and how they can be made to run as efficiently as possible. Please answer the following questions.<br><br>
<br>Star topology will be used in this network
<br><br>
<br>Central Connection Point (Hub, Switch, or Router)
<br>Nodes (Computers, Printers, Servers, etc.)
<br>Cabling
<br><br>
<br>Cost: This includes the initial setup expenses as well as ongoing maintenance and operation costs. Effective design balances affordability with performance and scalability requirements.
<br>Stability: A stable network ensures consistent availability and reliability, minimizing downtime and supporting productivity. This involves choosing dependable hardware and implementing redundancy where necessary.
<br>Scalability: The network should be able to grow and adapt to increased demands without extensive redesigns. This means planning for future expansions in users, devices, and data volumes.
<br>Performance: Network performance affects data transmission speed and efficiency. A well-designed network minimizes latency and maximizes throughput to provide a smooth user experience.
<br>Complexity: While some complexity might be necessary for functionality, a simpler network is generally easier to manage and troubleshoot. The goal is to find the optimal balance that meets the network's objectives without unnecessary complication.

State two reasons why some applications use error correction instead of error detection and retransmission.<br>
<br>For some application that need Real-time or Low latency, Delays in processes such as waiting for retransmissions can degrade the quality of service and the user experience.
<br>In environments where communication channels are inherently noisy or prone to high error rates (e.g., deep space communications, underwater communications), it may not be practical or efficient to retransmit data every time an error is detected.
<br><br>The Internet of Things (IoT) is doing great in many fields and services. Numerous IoT applications can ease our commercial operations. Suppose you are a project leader in a software house, and your team is required to write a proposal about IoT innovation. Please suggest what kind of application you would propose and why.<br>Proposal:<br>
<br>A Smart Waste Management System. This system would leverage IoT technology to optimize waste collection and processing in urban areas.
<br>Why:<br>
<br>A Smart Waste Management System utilizing IoT technology offers a holistic solution to urban waste challenges by enhancing environmental sustainability, reducing operational costs through optimized routes and schedules.

<br>定义：Hub是一种网络设备，用于将多个以太网设备连接在一起，使它们能够作为一个网络段进行通信。
<br>工作层次：物理层（OSI模型第1层）。
<br>工作原理：Hub通过广播的方式将收到的数据包发送到所有连接的端口，无论数据包的目的地是哪个设备。
<br>优点：价格低廉，易于安装和使用。
<br>缺点：效率低，所有端口共享带宽，容易发生碰撞（Collision），不适合大规模网络。
<br><br>Bridge: bridge operates on Ethernet frames and thus a layer-2 device. It does the following two functions:<br>
<br>Filtering: determine whether a frame should be forwarded to some interface or should just be dropped.
<br>Forwarding: determine the interfaces to which a frame should be directed.

<br>Forwarding means to place the packet in its route to its destination. 转发
<br>Forwarding requires a host or a router to have a routing table.
<br>When a host has a packet to send or when a router has received a packet to be forwarded, it looks at this table to find the route to the final destination.
<br><br>Shortest Path Routing <br>
<br>To study the routing algorithms, a graph is commonly used to represent a subnet.
<br>Each node of the graph represents a router and each arc of the graph represents a communication line.
<br>The path length can be measured in terms of the number of hops, the geographic distance, etc.
<br><br>Dijkstra Algorithm

<br>Set the value of the initial node to zero and set all other nodes to infinity.
<br>Mark all nodes unvisited. Set the initial node as starting point.
<br>For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances.
<br>Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
<br>If the destination node has been marked visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity, then stop. The algorithm has finished.
<br>Set the unvisited node marked with the smallest tentative distance as the next current node and go back to step 3.

<br><br>
<br>Every incoming packet is sent out on every outgoing line except the one it arrived on. 
<br>To solve the vast numbers of duplicate packets, a hop counter is introduced.
<br>The hop counter is contained in the header of each packet.
<br>It decremented at each hop. The packet will be discarded when the counter reached zero.
<br><br>
<br>It is a dynamic routing algorithm.
<br>Each router maintains a table giving the best known distance to each destination and which line to use to get there.
<br>These tables are updated by exchanging information with their neighbors.
<br>An entry of routing tables contains two parts: the preferred outgoing line to be used for the destination, and an estimate of the distance to that destination.

<br>Odd parity scheme: the parity bit value is chosen such that there is an odd number of 1s.<br>
<img alt="Parity Check" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/ParityCheck.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br><br>Two-dimensional Parity Check 
Two-dimensional parity is a generalization of single-bit ParityCheck.png 

<br>In this scheme, the data is formed as a rectangular matrix j bits wide and i bits high.
<br>A parity value is computed for each row and column. It has following properties:

<br>A single bit error can be detected.
<br>If there is a single error, we can use the column and row indices to identify the bit that was corrupted and correct that error.



<br> 2D Parity Check 
让我们通过一个具体的例子来说明二维奇偶校验（2D Parity Check）是如何工作的。假设我们有一个由二进制数据组成的3x3矩阵，我们想要通过添加行校验位和列校验位，以及一个额外的校验位来确保数据的完整性。

假设初始数据矩阵如下：
1 0 1
0 1 0
1 1 0

我们的目标是添加校验位，使得每行和每列的总和都是偶数（这里我们选择偶校验作为例子）。

首先，对于每一行，我们计算一个校验位，使得包括校验位在内的每一行的总位数（即1的数量）是偶数。

<br>第一行：1 0 1 有两个1，已经是偶数，所以校验位是0。
<br>第二行：0 1 0 有一个1，不是偶数，所以校验位是1。
<br>第三行：1 1 0 有两个1，已经是偶数，所以校验位是0。

添加行校验位后的矩阵：
1 0 1 | 0
0 1 0 | 1
1 1 0 | 0


然后，对于每一列（包括新添加的行校验位），我们也计算一个校验位，以确保每列的1的数量是偶数。

<br>第一列：1 0 1 有两个1，校验位是0。
<br>第二列：0 1 1 有两个1，校验位是0。
<br>第三列：1 0 0 有一个1，校验位是1。
<br>行校验列：0 1 0 有一个1，校验位是1。

添加列校验位后的矩阵：
1 0 1 | 0
0 1 0 | 1
1 1 0 | 0
------+---
0 0 1 | 1


最终，我们得到一个包含行校验位和列校验位的矩阵，还有一个右下角的额外校验位，用于整个矩阵的校验：
1 0 1 | 0
0 1 0 | 1
1 1 0 | 0
------+---
0 0 1 | 1

在这个例子中，每行和每列的1的数量都是偶数，包括最后添加的校验位行和校验位列。这样，在数据传输或存储过程中，如果任何单一位发生变化（变成错误），接收方可以通过检查行和列的校验位来发现并确定错误的具体位置。如果只有一位出错，那么错误可以被精确地定位和纠正。然而，如果有多个错误，这种方法可能只能检测到错误存在，而无法精确定位或纠正所有错误。
<br><br>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
CRC treats bit streams as representations of polynomials with coefficients of 0 and 1 only.

<br>Modulo-2 arithmetic is used for computing CRC.
<br>In modulo-2, there are no carriers for addition or borrows for subtraction.
<br>When the polynomial code method is employed, the sender and receiver must agree upon a generator polynomial, G(x) in advance.

<br>CRC Process
 To compute the checksum for some frame with m bits, corresponding to the polynomial  , we have following steps: 	

<br>Let  be the degree of . 
<br>Append zero bits to the low-order end of the frame so it now contains bits and corresponds to the polynomial 
<br>Divide  into  using modulo-2 division.
<br>Subtract the remainder from  using modulo-2 subtraction.
<br>Append the remainder to the end of  to form the transmitted data frame.

To detect the error, the receiver divides the checksummed frame by . If there is a remainder, there has been a transmission error.
<br>CRC Example
<img alt="CRC" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/CRC.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>
<br>The use of error-correcting codes is often referred to as forward error correction (FEC).
<br>Basic concepts<br>
-  Each block of data is mapped into an n-bit block, which consists of m data bits and r redundant. This n-bit block is referred to as an n-bit codeword.<br>
- Hamming distance is defined as the number of bit positions in which two code-words differ. For example (Hamming distance = 3):
Hamming Distance



<br>When transmission, each m-bits sequence is mapped into n-bit codeword. For example,  is mapped to  in the codeword table.<br><br>When the receiver receives an invalid codeword (detects an error), then the valid codeword that is closest to it (minimum hamming distance) is selected.<br><br>Hamming code---二进制的妙用
Design to correct single bit errors.<br>
Consists of two kinds of bits: check-bit and data-bit.<br>
The check-bits are in the positions which are power of 2 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc);<br>
The data-bits are in the rest position  (3, 5, 6, 7, 9, etc)<br>
Each check bit forces the parity of some collection of bits, including itself, to be even (or odd). 每个检验位对一组特定 位数进行包括其本身 进行奇偶检验

<br>The term telecommunication means communication at a distance.
<br>The word data refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data. 
<br>Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable.

<br>Analog signals are continuous electrical signals that vary in time. 模拟信号
<br>Digital signals are non-continuous. 数字信号<br>
- They consist of pulses or digits with discrete levels or values.<br>
- The value of each pulse is constant.<br>
- Digital signals usually have two amplitude levels such as 1 or 0, HIGH or LOW.<br>

<br>Non-return to zero digital encoding scheme 不归零数字编码方案

<br>‘1’ bit is sent as a high value and ‘0’ bit is sent as a low value.
<br>The receiver may lose synchronization because the data may contain long runs of consecutive bits with the same value [no changes in voltage].


<br>Manchester digital encoding scheme  曼彻斯特数字编码方案

<br>The digital data is represented as: ‘0’ bit by a voltage from low to high; ‘1’ bit by a voltage from high to low.
<br>Manchester encoding is a synchronous clock encoding technique to encode the clock and data of a synchronous bit stream.
<br>数字数据表示为:“0”位由电压由低到高; “1”位由电压由高到低。 曼切斯特编码是一种同步时钟编码技术，用于对同步比特流的时钟和数据进行编码。

<br>Efficiency : 50%


<br>4B/5B digital encoding scheme 

<br>It produces a signal for a group of bits each time, rather than outputting a signal for each individual bit.
<br>Each time, a 4-bit input data (16 different bit patterns) is encoded as a 5-bit data (32 different bit patterns).
<br>By carefully choosing the 5-bit patterns which always contain two '1's even if the input data is all '0's, the clock synchronizations can be achieved.
<br>它每次为一组位产生信号，而不是为每个单独的位输出信号。 每次，4位输入数据(16种不同的位模式)被编码为5位数据(32种不同的位模式)。 通过仔细选择总是包含两个'1'的5位模式，即使输入数据都是'0'，也可以实现时钟同步。

<br>Absence (or no carrier) :0

<br>FM - Frequency Modulation 调频

<br>A 0 is represented by the original carrier frequency
<br>A 1 by a much higher frequency (the cycles are spaced closer together).
<br><img alt="FM" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/FM.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>Frequency Modulation modifies the frequency of the carrier to represent the 1s or 0s. 操纵频率表示0/1


<br>PM - Phase Modulation 调相

<br>Pulse Coding Modulation 脉冲编码调制

<br>Sampling 采样

<br>是模拟-数字转换过程中的第一步，涉及按照特定的时间间隔（采样率）测量连续模拟信号的瞬时值。采样率必须至少是信号中最高频率的两倍，这是根据奈奎斯特定理来决定的，以确保信号可以被无失真地重建。


<br>Quantitation  量化

<br>采样后的步骤是量化，这个过程涉及将每个采样点的模拟值映射到最接近的数字级别。量化步骤确定了信号的数字表示可以取的不同值的数量。在图像中，量化被表示为一系列的水平线，每一条线对应一个量化级别。每个采样值被"量化"到最接近的这些水平线上。在量化过程中，采样值是用比特数表示的，而这个比特数（8位到24位）决定了可能的量化级别的数量，也就是量化精度。

<br><br>
<br>A network is a set of devices(often referred to as nodes) connected by communication links.
<br>A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.
<br><br>
<br>The computer networks can classified as the following 4 categories

<br>Local loop
<br>LANs
<br>MANs
<br>WANs


<br><br>
<br>It refers to the “last mile” of analog phone line that goes from the Exchange Centre to your house. 指从交换中心到您家的 "最后一英里 "模拟电话线。

<br>Voice lines 话频线路
<br>Modem (56 kbps) 调制解调器
<br>ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network): 2 x 64 kbps digital lines 
<br>ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line): up to 8 Mbps
<br>Cable Modems (up to 30 Mbps)  电缆调制解调器
<br>Network cable


<br><br>
<br>LANs are privately-owned networks within a single building or campus of up to a few kilometers in size.
<br>LANs run at speeds of 10Mbps to 10Gbps, have low delay, and make very few errors.
<br>The topologies 拓扑 of LANs are various: Bus, Ring, Star, etc.
<br><br>
<br>MANs are networks that connect LANs together within a city. 

<br>Example: Cable television network 


<br><br>
<br>WANs connect LANs together between cities.
<br>A WAN spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent.
<br><br>
<br>Many networks exists in the world with different hardware and software;  
<br>To communicate, it is better to connect different networks together.
<br>A collection of interconnected networks is called an internetwork or internet (which is used in a generic sense, in contrast to the worldwide Internet).
<br><br><br>Networks are recognized as a stack of layers or levels, each one built upon the one below it.<br>
<br>Each layer offers certain services to the higher layers, shielding those layers from the details of how the offered services are implemented.
<br>Between each pair of adjacent layers is an interface. The interface defines which primitives operations and services the lower layer makes available to the upper one.每一对相邻层之间都有一个接口。接口定义了下层向上层提供哪些基本操作和服务。
<br><br>Management of complex systems:<br>
<br>Modularization simplifies 

<br>Design 
<br>Maintenance
<br>Updating of a system


<br>Explicit structure allows

<br>Identification of the individual parts
<br>Relations among them


<br>Clear structure: layering

<br>Layered reference model
<br>Goal: different implementation of one layer fit with all implementations of other layers


<br><br>
<br>Addressing: Every layer needs a mechanism for identifying senders and receivers.
<br>Rules of data transfer: simplex or duplex, no. of channels
<br>Error control: Both sender and receiver must agree on some sort of error-detecting and error-correcting codes.
<br>Sequence: The protocol must provide solution for receiver to reassemble the messages properly.
<br>Flow control: The protocol should provide a mechanism for sender and receiver to regulate the transmission rate.
<br>Routing: A mechanism must be provided to choose a route when there are multiple paths between source and destination.
<br><br><br>
<br>To establish a connection, the sender, receiver and the subnet conduct a negotiation about parameters to be used, such as maximum message size, quality of service required, etc.

<br>The Quality of Service can be characterized in terms of Data Loss Rate, Delay Jitter, Data Rate, etc.
<br>Application Example: File transfer


<br><br>
<br>Each message carries the full destination address, and each one is routed through the system independent of all the others. 
<br>No negotiation is needed between sender and receiver.
<br><br>A service is formally specified by a set of primitives (operations) available to a user process to access the service. These primitives tell the service to perform some action or report on an action taken by a peer entity.<br><br><br>
<br>Network Topology refers to the layout of a network.
<br>Different configurations of network cable, computers and devices form different topologies.<br>
<img alt="Topology" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/Topology.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>
<br>Bus topology: All devices are connected to a common backbone.
<br><img alt="Bus" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/Topology/Bus.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>Advantages 

<br>Easy to connect a computer or peripheral to a linear bus. 方便连接
<br>Requires less cable length than a star topology. 耗材少


<br>Disadvantages

<br>Entire network shuts down if there is a break in the main cable. 不可靠
<br>Terminators are required at both ends of the backbone cable.
<br>Difficult to identify the problem if the entire network shuts down. o Not meant to be used as a stand-alone solution in a large building.


<br><br>
<br>Ring topology

<br>In a ring network, every device has exactly two neighbors for communication purposes 管理复杂


<br>All messages travel through a ring in the same direction (either "clockwise" or "counterclockwise")
<br><img alt="Ring" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/Topology/Ring.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>
<br>Star topology

<br>A star topology is designed with each node (file server, workstations, and peripherals) connected directly to a central network hub or concentrator.
<br>Data on a star network passes through the hub or concentrator before continuing to its destination.
<br>The hub or concentrator manages and controls all functions of the network.
<br>It also acts as a repeater for the data flow.


<br>Advantages Current-connections

<br>Easy to install and wire.
<br>No disruptions to the network then connecting or removing devices.
<br>Easy to detect faults and to remove parts.


<br>Disadvantages

<br>Requires more cable length than a linear topology.
<br>If the hub or concentrator fails, nodes attached are disabled.
<br>More expensive than linear bus topologies because of the cost of the concentrators.


<br><img alt="Star" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/Topology/Star.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>
<br>A tree topology combines characteristics of star and linear bus topologies.
<br>Tree topologies allow for the expansion of an existing network. 

<br>For example, enabling schools to configure a network for labs.


<br>Advantages

<br>Point-to-point wiring for individual segments.
<br>Supported by several hardware and software venders. 


<br>Disadvantages

<br>Overall length of each segment is limited by the type of cabling used.
<br>If the backbone line breaks, the entire segment goes down.
<br>More difficult to configure and wire than other topologies. 


<br><img alt="Tree" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Network/Topology/Tree.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>
<br>A Mesh topology consists of a network where every device on the network is physically connected to every other device on the network.
<br>Advantages

<br>It provides a great deal of performance and reliability. 


<br>Disadvantages

<br>However the complexity and difficulty of creating one increases geometrically as the number of nodes on the network increases.

<br>Atomicity of updates<br>
For example, it can ensure that fund transfers between accounts are either successfully completed or not executed at all. In database systems, this guarantee can prevent situations where funds are deducted for some reason but not added to another account, thereby avoiding data inconsistency and financial losses. File systems lack such guarantees, making inconsistencies more likely in such transactions.
<br>Concurrent access by multiple users<br>
For example, database systems enable multiple students to enroll in courses simultaneously, enhancing system performance. However, without proper management, uncontrolled concurrent access may lead to issues like overbooking courses, causing frustration among students.
<br>Security problems<br>
For example, in a healthcare database, it's vital to control access to patient records. Database systems offer fine-grained access control, allowing restrictions based on roles. For instance, doctors and nurses can access medical records, but administrative staff cannot. Achieving this control is challenging in a file system, posing security risks.

 <br><br><br>REmote DIctionary Server（Redis）是一个开源的内存 NoSQL 数据库项目，它实现了一个分布式、内存键值存储，并具有可选的耐用性。<br><br>
<br>读写速度极快
<br>持久、可扩展
<br>直接数据访问
<br><br>
<br>String
<br>List
<br>Hash
<br>Set 
<br>Zset
<br><br>
<br>发送者（发布者）不需要向特定的接收者（订阅者）发送消息。 
<br>相反，发布的消息被归类到频道中，而不知道有哪些订阅者。 
<br>订阅者对一个或多个频道表示兴趣，只接收感兴趣的信息，而不知道有哪些发布者。
<br><br>依靠原子性实现•要么处理所有命令，要么不处理任何命令。<br>
EXEC 命令会触发事务中所有命令的执行。<br>
如果客户端在调用 MULTI 命令之前，在事务上下文中失去了与服务器的连接，则不会执行任何操作。相反，如果调用 EXEC 命令，则会执行所有操作。<br><br>
<br>Redis最与众不同的数据结构是：ZSet
<br>特点：

<br>对排序集进行添加、删除或更新等操作的速度非常快
<br>由于元素是按顺序提取的，而不是事后排序，因此还可以通过得分或排名（位置）快速获取范围。


<br><br>Expire 命令可以为键设置过期时间，当键过期时，Redis 会自动删除该键。<br><br>
<br>场景：MySQL+ Redis 的组合使用，Redis 作为 MySQL 的缓存层使用，MySQL作为主要存储
<br>原因：Redis 是一个高性能的缓存数据库，可以快速读写数据，适合存储热点数据，提高系统性能。
<br><br>Cassandra 是：<br>
<br>一种开源、可线性扩展、分布式和容错的 NoSQL 数据库。设计用于处理海量数据。
<br>主要特点：	<br>
<br>大规模可扩展架构
<br>无主架构
<br>线性扩展性能 
<br>无单点故障 
<br>故障节点可轻松恢复
<br>具有灵活、动态的数据模型，可调整的数据一致性，多数据中心复制 
<br>数据压缩效率高
<br><br>
<br>传统关系型数据库面向行设计，内部组织结构围绕行的处理，适合 OLTP场景
<br>Cassandra 列族数据库面向列设计，主要处理列，适合 OLAP 场景
<br><br>复制策略是指 Cassandra 如何在集群中复制数据，放置数据副本<br>
<br>Cassandra 提供两种复制策略，包括SimpleStrategy 和 NetworkTopologyStrategy

<br>SimpleStrategy 用于只有一个数据中心的情况。SimpleStrategy 会在分区器选择的节点上放置第一个副本。之后，其余副本按顺时针方向放置在节点环中。	
<br>NetworkTopologyStrategy 用于有多个数据中心的情况。在网络拓扑策略中，会为每个数据中心分别设置副本。网络拓扑策略在环中按顺时针方向放置副本，直到到达另一个机架中的第一个节点


<br><br>
<br>Cassandra 使用标记删除的方式，而不是立即删除数据。标记删除的数据会在后续的清理过程中删除。<br>
注意的地方：
<br>如果标记删除的数据过多，会影响查询性能，因为查询时需要扫描和过滤这些标记删除的数据。
<br>需要注意Cassandra表的TTL（生存时间）设置，如果TTL设置不当，可能导致大量的tombstone积累。
<br><br>Cassandra Query Language（CQL）是 Cassandra 数据库的查询语言。<br><br>Apache Cassandra 的设计目标主要围绕着可扩展性、高可用性和无单点故障展开。<br><br>Cassandra 的主要成分包括：	<br>
<br>节点
<br>数据中心
<br>集群
<br>分区器
<br><br>社交媒体的评论管理<br>
Cassandra 面向列设计，适合处理大量数据，适合社交媒体评论管理场景，可以快速写入和读取评论数据，支持高并发读写操作。	]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/assignment/nosql-as-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Database Management System/Assignment/NoSQL-As-2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NoSQL-Assignment-1]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:NoSQL" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#NoSQL</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:Assignment" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#Assignment</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:Neo4j" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#Neo4j</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:Mongodb" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#Mongodb</a>

<br>NoSQL数据库是不遵循RDBMS原则的数据库和数据存储，NoSQL意思是不仅仅是 SQL
<br><br>
<br>图数据库:

<br>用于存储数据网络信息，如社交关系。
<br>如：<a data-href="Neo4j" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/Neo4j" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Neo4j</a><a data-href="Neo4j" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/nosql/neo4j.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Neo4j</a>


<br>文档数据库:

<br>将每个键与称为文档的复杂数据结构配对。
<br>如：<a data-href="MongoDB" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/MongoDB" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">MongoDB</a><a data-href="MongoDB" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/nosql/mongodb.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">MongoDB</a>


<br>键值数据库:

<br>是最简单的 NoSQL 数据库。数据库中的每个项目都以属性名称（或 "键"）的形式与其值一起存储。
<br>如：<a data-href="Redis" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/Redis" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Redis</a><a data-href="Redis" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/nosql/redis.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Redis</a>


<br>列族数据库：

<br>针对大型数据集的查询进行了优化，将数据列（而不是行）存储在一起。
<br>如：<a data-href="Cassandra" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/Cassandra" class="original-internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Cassandra</a><a data-href="Cassandra" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/nosql/cassandra.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cassandra</a>


<br><br>
<br>关系型数据库

<br>中心化的
<br>处理密集，结构化的数据
<br>满足 ACID 性
<br>遵循 CA 原则


<br>NoSQL

<br>去中心化的
<br>处理稀疏数据，半/非结构化的数据
<br>主要是查询，很少更新
<br>满足 BASE 性
<br>遵循 AP 或 CP 原则


<br><br>
<br>CAP 定理（CAP Theorem）

<br>是由计算机科学家 Eric Brewer 提出的一个关于分布式数据存储系统的基本定理。该定理指出，在任何分布式数据存储系统中，无法同时完全满足以下三个特性：

<br>一致性（Consistency）：每个客户端都有相同的数据视图。
<br>可用性（Availability）：每个客户端始终可以读写。
<br>分区容错性（Partition Tolerance）：系统在分布式物理网络中运行良好




<br>CAP 定理在 NoSQL 数据库中的重要性

<br>NoSQL 数据库的设计通常会在 CAP 定理的背景下进行权衡，以满足特定应用场景的需求：

<br>满足CA原则：系统几乎没有或根本没有分区容错性。一致性和可用性优先
<br>满足AP原则：一致性受到影响，但系统始终可用，并且在部分分区时也能工作

<br>Cassandra, DynamoDB


<br>满足CP原则：可用性受到影响，但一致性和分区容错性优于可用性

<br>MongoDB, HBase, Redis






<br><br>
<br>a.高可用性 (High Availability)

<br>每个客户端始终可以读写，读写实时更新


<br>b. 可扩展性 (Scalability)

<br>存储空间可扩展
<br>数据易于扩展


<br>c. 分布式系统 (Distributed System)

<br>去中心化的系统
<br>可有数千台机器分布在世界各地


<br><br>
<br>a.键值存储(Key-Value Store)

<br>简洁：数据主要采用Key-Value(KV)形式储存
<br>高速：数据驻留内存，重启时可再次加载进行使用
<br>易扩展：根据系统负载量，灵活添加或删除服务器
<br>对键可设置失效时间


<br>b. 列存储 (Column Store)

<br>更好的可扩展性
<br>高可用性
<br>适合离线批量数据处理


<br>c.文档数据库(Document Store)

<br>核心概念是 "文档 "的概念，它与 RDBMS 中的行相对应
<br>以某些标准格式或编码封装和编码数据，如 JSON（BSON）
<br>文档在数据库中通过代表该文档的唯一密钥进行处理
<br>将文档作为一个整体处理，避免将文档拆分为其组成的名称/值对
<br>文档是无模式的，可以是非结构的数据


<br>d.图形数据库(Graph Store)

<br>面向图形
<br>一切都以边、节点或属性的形式存储
<br>每个节点和边可以有任意数量的属性
<br>节点和边都可以贴标签
<br>标签可用于缩小搜索范围


<br><br>
<br>a. 实时分析：

<br>键值数据库Redis,  支持极高的读写速度，适合需要快速响应的实时分析应用。


<br>b. 大数据处理：

<br>列族数据库 Cassandra, 能够轻松地横向扩展，处理大数据量和高吞吐量的需求。


<br>c. 社交网络：

<br>图数据库 Neo4J，社交网络中的数据天然适合图模型，例如用户、朋友关系、点赞、评论等。Neo4j 通过图形算法和索引，能够高效地进行复杂的关系查询和路径查找，


<br>d. 物联网 loT:

<br>文档数据库MongoDB，能够处理结构化、半结构化和非结构化数据。物联网数据通常包括各种类型的传感器数据，这些数据具有高度的灵活性和多样性。MongoDB 提供了高效的存储和查询能力，支持时间序列数据的存储和分析，适合物联网应用中大量多变的数据处理需求。


<br><br>
<br>实际应用场景：社交媒体评论管理

<br>社交媒体评论具有大量非结构化的数据，且用户在高峰期频繁发布和查看评论，系统需要支持高并发读写操作。
<br>NoSQL 数据库具有可扩展性：NoSQL 数据库（如 MongoDB、Cassandra）能够水平扩展，通过增加更多节点来处理大规模数据和高并发请求。
<br>关系型数据库通常难以应对如此大规模的数据增长和高并发需求。


<br><br>MATCH (v:Vehicle)-[:OWNED_BY]-&gt;(p:Person)
WITH p, collect(p.name) as owners
RETURN v, owners
<br><br><br><br>
<br>A.&nbsp;OPTIONAL MATCH 不是 Cypher 语句。
<br>B.&nbsp;OPTIONAL MATCH 为 Cypher 查询提供参数占位符。它保存参数化查询，然后根据客户提供的值与图进行可选匹配。
<br>C. OPTIONAL MATCH 会搜索可能存在也可能不存在的描述模式，并将模式中不存在的标识符赋值为 NULL。
<br>D. 可选匹配子句将获取一组属性值，并将其与数据库中的所有节点进行可选匹配。
<br><br>
<br>A.&nbsp;MATCH (a:Thing {id:3563}) DETACH DELETE a
<br>B.&nbsp;MATCH (a:Thing {id:3563}) OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[r]-() DELETE a, r
<br>C.&nbsp;MATCH (a:Thing {id:3563}) DELETE a
<br>D.&nbsp;MATCH (a:Thing {id:3563})-[r]-(b) DELETE a, r
<br><br>
<br>A.&nbsp;MATCH (sarah:Person)-[:KNOWS]-&gt;(friend:Person) WHERE sarah.name = "Sarah" RETURN friend
<br>B.&nbsp;MATCH (sarah:Person)-[:KNOWS*1...2]-&gt;(friend:Person) WHERE sarah.name = "Sarah" RETURN friend
<br>C. MATCH (sarah:Person)-[:KNOWS]-&gt;(friend:Person) OPTIONAL MATCH (friend)-[:KNOWS]-&gt;(fof:Person) WHERE sarah.name = "Sarah" RETURN friend, fof
<br>D. 所有这些都是正确的。

<br>Subquery

<br>IN subquery

<br>
.<br><br>The two tables of the union must be compatible: corresponding columns must be of the same type.<br>TableA UNION TableB;
<br>
<br>MySQL is very robust. It allows union between different types.

 <br><br><br>
<br>The domain of each data type contains a special value – NULL.

<br>NULL means the value is unknown or does not exist.
<br>NULL values can participate calculations in the arithmetic expressions
<br>aggregation functions, comparisons, and predicates (logical test) in the WHERE clause.


<br><br>
<br>To check whether a value of an attribute is NULL (atomic predicate)
<br>WHERE attribute IS NULL
<br>
<br>Any arithmetic expression which has NULL values is evaluated as NULL.<br>
For example, this query is same as the above.<br>
SELECT * FROM staff WHERE (picture+1) IS NULL
<br><br>Different aggregation functions treat NULL values differently.<br>
<br>
If NULL values and non-NULL values are mixed,

<br>all aggregation functions ignore NULL values.


<br>
If the group only consists of NULL values,

<br>count returns 0;
<br>other aggregation functions return NULL.


<br>
如果NULL与非NULL的属性混合 那么所有aggregation function会忽略 NULL

<br>
如果只有NULL，那么count() return 0,其他aggragation function return NULL

<br><br>
<br>The logic with NULL values has three constants:

<br>TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN 三值判断体系


<br>A comparison with NULL values is evaluated as UNKNOWN.<br>
To check whether a logical constant is UNKNOWN, use IS UNKNOWN.<br>
For example, try the query and check the outcome.
<br>SELECT staff_id FROM staff WHERE (staff_rating&gt;5) IS UNKNOWN<br>
<br>
如果某个 attribute = NULL 那么他的逻辑判断结果 为 UNKNOWN

<br>
OR:

<br>(unknown OR true) = true
<br>(unknown OR false) = unknown
<br>(unknown OR unknown) = unknown


<br>
AND:

<br>(true AND unknown) = unknown
<br>(false AND unknown) = false
<br>(unknown AND unknown) = unknown


<br>
NOT:

<br>(NOT unknown) = unknown


<br><br>
<br>A subquery is a query (SELECT…FROM…WHERE) inside another query.
<br>Subqueries can be in all of SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.<br>In the FROM clause, users need to indicate some tables.<br>
A “SELECT…FROM…WHERE…” query returns a temporary table. (The type is matched.)]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/mysql/07-null-subquery.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Database Management System/MySQL/07-Null-Subquery.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:22:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data-Modification]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Usually, database users are only allowed to change data (table rows), which is covered by this lab.<br>
Table columns are related to the logical design and are managed by database managers.<br>
To change the logical design, you need ALTER TABLE (last lab).<br><br>
<br>To insert a record for a program:
<br>Program code: 1001<br>
Program name: Computer Science<br>
Division: Science and Technology<br>
Director: NULL (unknown)<br>INSERT INTO program (p_code, p_name, division, director_id) VALUES (1001, 'Computer Science', 'Science and Technology', NULL);
<br>The schema of the table is to remind users the data types, which can be omitted.<br>
Currently, the instructor table is empty. So, the program director is unknown.<br>
<br>Insert Example
<br>Course:
Name: Introduction to Biology,   Credits: 3, 
Domain: ENVS,      Course Number: 2001

Instructor:
ID: 20002,   Name: S.H. Zee,  Title: Professor, 
Salary: 100000,  Program: Environmental Science

Program:
ID: 1002,      Name: Environmental Science,  
Division: Science and Technology,  Program director: Unknown
<br>the instructor cannot be inserted before the program<br>INSERT INTO course VALUES 
('Introduction to Biology', 3, 'ENVS', 2001);

INSERT INTO program VALUES 
(1002, 'Environmental Science', 'Science and Technology', NULL);

INSERT INTO program VALUES
(20002, 'S.H. Zee', 'Professor', 100000, 1002);
<br>
<br>Sometimes we can insert data constructed from other tables.<br>
Suppose we want to express that the program Environmental Science offers the course Introduction to Biology.
<br>INSERT INTO offer 
        SELECT p_code,c_name 
        FROM program,course 
        WHERE p_name='Environmental Science' 
          AND c_name = 'Introduction to Biology '
<br>
<br>SELECT…FROM…WHERE… constructs the tuples which are inserted to “offer”.
<br><br>
<br>Suppose Prof. S.T. Kwok becomes the new program director for Computer Science. We need to update the table.
<br>UPDATE program 
SET director_id = (SELECT id FROM instructor WHERE i_name='S.T. Kwok') 
WHERE p_name = 'Computer Science'
<br>UPDATE: the keyword to update a table, followed by the table name.<br>
SET: the keyword to update a specific column, followed by an assignment operation.<br>
(…): a subquery to find the person id of S.T. Kwok.<br>
WHERE: only update the rows which satisfy the condition in the WHERE clause.<br><br>
<br>Suppose Prof. S.T. Kwok has retired. All his information should be removed from the system.
<br>DELETE FROM instructor WHERE i_name='S.T. Kwok'
<br>
<br>Every row which satisfies the condition will be removed. Thus, be careful.

<br>“Aggregation” means performing some operations on a group of objects.
<br>COUNT: count the value<br>
MAX: find the maximum value<br>
MIN: find the minimum value<br>
AVG: calculate the average value<br>
SUM: sum up the values<br><br>
<br>Suppose that we want to count the number of different languages.
<br>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM language
<br>
<br>In this example, all tuples in the table “language” is considered as a group. The query counts the number of distinct objects in the group.<br>
After applying an aggregation function, the result of COUNT(*) is treated as an attribute.
<br><br>
<br>For example, find the number of films for each language. The resulting table has two columns, one for languages, one for the number of films.
<br>Only those films of the same language are in the same group (different language different group).<br>
Then, count the number within each group.<br>
<br>To achieve the grouping, we use GROUP BY.
<br>SELECT language_id, count(film_id) 
FROM film JOIN language USING(language_id) 
GROUP BY (language_id) 
<br>
<br>To indicate the result of aggregation of each group, group by attributes are usually selected.
<br><br>
<br>
Sometimes we need condition checking before and after aggregation functions

<br>
For example, show the actors’ names and the number of Sci-Fi movies played by him/her if the number of Sci-Fi movies is more than 3

<br>SELECT actor_id,first_name,last_name,COUNT(film_id)
FROM actor JOIN film_actor USING (actor_id) 
    JOIN film USING(film_id) 
    JOIN film_category USING(film_id)
    JOIN category USING(category_id)
WHERE category.name='sci-fi'
GROUP BY actor_id
HAVING COUNT(film_id)&gt;3;
<br>
<br>The query is executed in this sequence.
<br>
<br>Combine the tables in FROM clause
<br>Check the condition in WHERE clause
<br>Group tuples
<br>Aggregation function
<br>Check the condition in HAVING clause
<br>Output the selected attributes
<br><br>Assuming that every country has a city. Why the following query cannot find the number of countries?<br>SELECT COUNT(country_id)
FROM city
<br>We only assume that every country has a city. But, a country may have multiple cites.<br>
Those countries will be over counted.<br>
We can use DISTINCT to remove duplications.<br>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_id)
FROM city

<br>
<br>Are you tired of condition checking in cross table queries?
<br>The NATURAL JOIN operator associates two tables by the common attributes.<br>
After NATURAL JOIN, the duplicated attributes are omitted.<br>SELECT * FROM city NATURAL JOIN country
<br>is implemented as<br>SELECT city.country_id, city.last_update, city_id, city, country
FROM city, country
WHERE city.country_id = country.country_id AND
    city.last_update = country.last_update
<br><br>
<br>Join conditions define in which condition the tuples are associated.
<br>Two tuples are associated if

<br>NATURAL: all common attributes have the same value.
<br>ON &lt;predicate&gt;: the predicate is evaluated to be true.
<br>USING : the common attributes in list have the same value.


<br>For example, these queries are equivalent.<br>SELECT first_name, last_name, address, district, postal_code 
FROM customer NATURAL JOIN address

SELECT first_name, last_name, address, district, postal_code
FROM customer JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id AND customer.last_update = address.last_update

SELECT first_name, last_name, address, district, postal_code
FROM customer JOIN address USING (address_id, last_update)
<br><br>
<br>A JOIN without any condition is same as a cartesian product.<br>
Sometimes more than two tables are joined together.
<br><br>
<br>The NATURAL JOIN operator associates two tables by all the common attributes.<br>
基于两个表之间的相同列名来进行连接。当使用自然连接时，数据库系统会自动查找两个表中列名相同的字段，并将它们用作连接条件，返回一个新表，其中包含了这些字段的所有数据。
<br>SELECT * FROM city NATURAL JOIN country
is equivalent to
SELECT city.country_id, city.last_update, city_id, city,country
FROM city, country
WHERE city.country_id = country.country_id AND
city.last_update = country.last_update
<br>  SELECT *FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2 NATURAL JOIN table3  
<br>The query is understood as<br>  SELECT* FROM (table1 NATURAL JOIN table2) NATURAL JOIN table3
<br>只保留相同的部分<br>Notes:<br>
<br>The predicate in the ON clause is user-defined, which is very flexible.
<br>NATURAL and USING combine the common attributes. But ON duplicates common attributes.
<br><br>当需要无法匹配的部分时<br>
<br>Sometimes users want to keep the unmatched tuples after joining two tables.
<br>OUTER JOIN can handle it.<br>
<br>
table1 NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN table2<br>
All tuples in table1 are in the result. For the unmatched tuples, the values of the attributes from table2 are NULL, meaning “unknown”. (NULL values will be introduced in following labs.)

<br>
table1 NATURAL RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2<br>
The unmatched tuples from table2 are kept.

<br>
table1 NATURAL FULL OUTER JOIN table2<br>
All tuples (from both table1 and table2) are kept.

<br>
NATURAL is the join condition.

<br>On the opposite of OUTER, INNER JOIN does not keep the unmatched tuples.<br>
Same as JOIN. “INNER” is usually omitted.<br>Suppose we try to join this 2 tables<br>

 <br><br>The basic query has three clauses: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE.<br>
<br>
SELECT: contains one or multiple attributes.<br>
These attributes are displayed in the result.<br>
The symbol “*” means all attributes.

<br>
The FROM clause contains one or more tables.

<br>
The WHERE clause contains a single predicate.<br>
It is a logical test on every row of the table which returns true or false.<br>
If multiple queries are executed at the same time, a semicolon “;” is used as a delimiter to split two queries.

<br>
A query is executed as follows.<br>
The system test the predicate on every tuple from the table in the FROM clause.<br>
If a tuple satisfies the predicate, show the values of the attributes in the SELECT clause in the result.

<br><br>
<br>The predicate in the WEHERE clause is regarded as a logic test.<br>
The return value of a predicate is a Boolean, either 1 (True) or 0 (False).
<br>Formally, suppose op is a relation operator, which can be =, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, and &lt;&gt; (not equal);<br>
a predicate can be a single term
<br>  pred = term
  term = exp op exp
<br>“exp” is an arithmetic expression which contains attributes and constants.<br>For example<br>rental_rate &lt; 1
<br>
<br>A predicate can also be a composition of terms.
<br>  pred = NOT pred
  pred = pred AND pred
  pred = pred OR pred
<br>NOT, AND, OR are logical operators.<br>
For example,<br>NOT rental_rate &lt; 1
(NOT rental_rate &lt; 1) AND release_year = 2006
<br>SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating="PG-13"
<br>SQL is case insensitive.<br>
However, to make query readable, we write<br>
key words (like SELECT, FROM, etc.) in capital;<br>
attributes and tables in lower cases; and string constant in the original form.<br>In general, a basic query is in the form<br>SELECT a1,⋯,an FROM r WHERE P
<br>where  are attributes; r is a table; and P is a predicate.]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/mysql/01-basic-mysql.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Database Management System/MySQL/01-Basic-MySQL.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:21:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Final Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Thus, we define a weaker normal form called Third Normal Form (3NF).

<br>3NF allows some redundancy

There is always a lossless-join, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF.

 <br><br>Functional dependencies are some constraints on the set of legal relations.<br>
The constraint is that the value for a certain set of attributes uniquely determines the value for another set of attributes. 约束条件是一组属性的值唯一确定另一组属性的值<br>

we have a larger schema<br>

From the example, we see redundancy occurs.<br>
<br>Small Schema
<br>Sometimes decompositions are useless.<br>
Sometimes naive decompositions create inconsistency.<br><br>For one attribute A of the schema, the other attributes it can be  identified.<br>
A-&gt;B,C,D<br><br>A domain is atomic if its elements are considered to be indivisible units.<br>

<br>no need to create a schema for the entity set on the higher level;

<br>

<br><br>Aggregations are treated same as other relationship sets.<br>

<br>Design Techniques
<br>Attributes vs Entity
<br>Entity set vs Relationship set
<br>Weak entity sets
<br>Redundancies
<br><br>
<br>Express all constraints (you can express!).
<br>Use and do not change terminology and class structure of the application domain.
<br>Keep it simple.<br>
Avoid defining entity types that do not serve any purpose.<br>
Don’t use an entity set when an attribute will do. Choose an entity set if it helps expressing constraints; otherwise, use an attribute.
<br>Avoid redundancy (but derived attributes are okay)!
<br>Limit the use of weak entity sets.
<br><br>
<br>Attribute vs Entity
<br>Entity set vs Relationship set
<br>Strong entity sets vs Weak entity sets
<br>Binary relationship vs multi-ary relationship
<br>Try to eliminate redundancy<br>
In most cases, the answer is very subjective. It depends on the real-world problem.<br>
Sometimes, the answers can be very different even on the same problem but with different assumptions.<br><br>It depends on the real case.<br>
Both ER models have advantages and disadvantages.<br>]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/rdbms/04-design-issues.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Database Management System/RDBMS/04-Design-Issues.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:19:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Entity-Relationship-Model-Extended-Features]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Aggregation 聚合
<br>Weak Entity Sets
<br>Generalization and Specialization
<br><br>let “student”, “instructor”, “course”, and “enroll” form an abstract entity as an aggregation. Then “project” only need to associate with the courses which has a course project.<br>
<img alt="MnKmwI" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/MnKmwI.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>A weak entity is an entity cannot exist alone. The existence depends on another entity of a different type.<br>
弱实体不单独存在，必须依附于实体<br>
A set of weak entities is a weak entity set. Since a weak entity cannot exist alone, it does not have a key.<br>
The existence of a weak entity set depends on the existence of an identifying entity set.<br>
<br>
A weak must relate to the identifying entity set via a total, one-to-many relationship set from the identifying to the weak entity set.

<br>
An identifying relationship depicted using a double diamond. 用双线菱形表示identifying relationship

<br>
The discriminator(鉴别器) (or partial key) of a weak entity set is the set of attributes that distinguishes among all the entities of a weak entity set.<br>
To distinguish weak entities, one must combine the key of the identifying entity set and the discriminator

<br>
Example

<br>Our original modeling for courses was not accurate.<br>
Instead of saying “a student is enrolled to a course”, it’s better to say, “a student is enrolled to a section of a course”.<br>
Same for instructors, one instructor may teach multiple sections of one course.<br>
An entity set “section” is needed.<br>
But a section needs to be with a course.<br>
Thus, “section” is a weak entity set which depends on “course”.<br>

Dashed underlines denote discriminators of weak entity sets. 虚线下划线 表示 weak entity的键<br>
Double diamonds denote identifying relationship sets.<br>
Assume we model the original “enroll” relationship set without constraints. <a data-footref="[inline0" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/about:blank#fn-1-09418c4b25513546" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a><br><br>
<br>
Generalization (泛化) is the process of extracting common properties from a set of entities and create a generalized entity from it. It is a bottom-up approach in which two or more entities can be generalized to a higher level entity if they have some attributes in common.

<br>
specialization (具象化), an entity is divided into sub-entities based on their characteristics. It is a top-down approach where higher level entity is specialized into two or more lower level entities.

<br>
泛化 抽象实体集的共同特征 bottom-up

<br>
具象化 Top-down

<br>
Does one higher-level entity belong to at least one lower-level entity set?<br>
If yes, this ISA is a total generalization.<br>
If no, this ISA is a partial generalization

<br>
Does one higher-level entity belong to multiple lower-level entity set?<br>
If No, it is a disjoint generalization.<br>
If no, it’s a overlapping generalization

<br>
Similar to the Inheritance<br>
<img alt="ER-Generalization.png" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-Generalization.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br>Cardinality constraints and participation constraints can be applied on ISA relationship sets.<br>
But some constraints are omitted because<br>
each entity on the lower-level is one entity on the higher-level (the entity sets on the lower-level always fully participate ISA);<br>
one entity cannot be associated with multiple entities in the same entity set on the lower-level.<br>
Thus, the constraints on ISA only discuss<br>
Does one higher-level entity belong to at least one lower-level entity set?<br>
If yes, this ISA is a total generalization.<br>
Does one higher-level entity belong to multiple lower-level entity set?<br>
If No, it is a disjoint generalization.<br>The above design process is bottom-up, combining several entity sets with same attributes into higher-level entity set.<br>
But sometimes the process is reversed.<br>
Some entity sets can be split into some lower-level entity sets with specific attributes.<br>
This top-down process is called specialization.<br>Consider the “student” and “instructor” example.<br>
If we want to express every person is either a student or an instructor, then this is a total generalization.<br>
And if we assume nobody can be a student and an instructor at the same time, this is a disjoint generalization.<br>

“how many entities can be associated with one entity at most (or at least)?”

<br>
Can one student have multiple majors?

<br>
Can one program have multiple students?

<br>
Does every student have a major?

<br>
Is every program the major for some students?

<br>
To express the answers, ER diagrams have constraints on relationship sets.
<br>Two types of constraints<br>
<br>Cardinality constraints
<br>Participation constraints
<br>
“Cardinality” is a term from set theory. It is the number of items in a set.
<br><br>To express the cardinality constraints.<br>
ER diagrams use an arrow  pointing to the one side.<br>
For the many side, the links simply have no arrow ().<br><br>
<br>An example for Cardinality Constraints One to many relationships:
<br><img alt="Many-to-one" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER/Many-to-one.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
Many student can only have one program
<br>Here are some conditions for the example:<br>
<br>one student can only associate with at most one program as his/her major
<br>one major program can have many students.
<br>A one-to-many relationship is the reverse of many-to-one.<br><br>One entity from one entity set is associated with at most one entity from the other entity set and vice versa.<br>
<br>For example, one instructor can be the program director of at most one program, and one program has at most one program director.
<br><img alt="One-to-one" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER/One-to-one.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>One entity from one entity set can be associated with multiple entities from the other entity set and vice versa.<br>
<br>For example, one student can borrow multiple books, and one book can be borrowed by multiple students.
<br><img alt="Many-to-many" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-Many-to-many.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>Total Participation

<br>Every entity participates a relationship.
<br>The link is a double line (=).


<br>Partial Participation

<br>There are some entities do not participate any relationship.
<br>The link is a single line (−).


<br><br>
<br>Example:<br>
Every student has a major.<br>
Every program is the major for some students. (Programs also totally participate.)
<br><img alt="Total-participation" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-Total-participation.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>Example:<br>
It’s possible that an instructors is not a program director for any program.<br>
But every program has a program director.

If expressing constraints is important, ternary relationship sets can always be converted into several binary ones.<br>Non-binary relationships with constrains is complex.<br>
<br>Not suggested to use constraints on non-binary relationships (ambiguous)
<br>See lecture: convert non-binary to binary

The goal of the relational database design is to create a database in a specific database management system that allows us to

<br>Store information
<br>Minimize unnecessary redundancies
<br>Search information easily


<br>
Design database can be split into multiple phases.<br>
<img alt="Design-database" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Design-database.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br><br>
<br>Focus on describing data and their relationships.
<br>The outcome of this phase is an ER diagram.
<br>It provides a graphic representation of the database design.<br>
<img alt="ER-diagram-example" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-diagram-example.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>
However, designing an ER diagram can be very subjective. Then, the next phase is optimizing the ER diagram using functional dependencies and normal forms.
<br><br>
<br>Optimizing the ER diagram using functional dependencies and normal forms.
<br><br>This phase is to convert an ER diagram to the implementation data model of the database system that will be used.<br><br>
<br>Relational schemas will be produced.<br>
The relational schemas of a database are called logical view.
<br><br>
<br>Designers will implement the relational schemas in the database management system using a particular data definition language.
<br><br>
<br>The entity-relationship model contains three basic concepts:

<br>entity sets
<br>relationship sets
<br>attributes


<br>An entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world, which is distinguishable from all other objects.<br>
An entity set is the class or type of objects in our model.<br><br>
<br>An entity can be described by a set of properties.
<br>Each property is an attribute of the entity.
<br>A set of attributes describes and distinguishes the entities in the same entity set.
<br>One entity can have different attributes in different models for different applications.
<br>Each entity has a value for each of its attributes.
<br>The Domain of an attribute is the set of all possible values of the attribute.
<br><br>
<br>rectangles represent entity sets
<br>ellipses represent attributes
<br>keys are underlined
<br>lines link attributes to entity sets<br>
<img alt="Basic-ER-Features" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Basic-ER-Features.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>a relationship set is denoted by a diamond<br>
<img alt="ER-Relationship-set-diamond" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-Relationship-set-diamond.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>
<br>The set of special attribute(s) is called key.
<br>Formally, a key of an entity set is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify the entities.
<br>Two entities are identical if and only if they have the same value for the key.
<br><br>
<br>An entity may have multiple values in an attribute which is multi-valued attribute, denoted by double ellipses.
<br><img alt="Multiple-valued-Attribute" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-Multiple-valued-Attribute.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
It is possible that one student may have multiple phone numbers.<br><br>
<br>One may ask “why the course code is not selected as a key?”
<br>The reason is that a course code is not atomic.

<br>An attribute is atomic if each value of the attribute has only one unit of information.
<br>If an attribute is not atomic, it is a composite attribute.


<br><img alt="Composite-attribute" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Composite-attribute.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<img alt="Composite-attribute" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Compositive-attribute-Example.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>A relationship set is a set of relationships of the same type.<br>
<img alt="ER-Relationship-set" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-Relationship-set.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>Sets do not allow duplications.
<br>This is also applied to entity sets.
<br><br>
<br>If a relationship associates 𝑛 entities, this relationship is 𝒏-ary.
<br>𝑛 is the degree of the relationship
<br>If 𝑛 = 2, the relationship is binary.
<br>If 𝑛 = 3, the relationship is ternary.
<br>Theoretically, 𝑛 can be any positive integer.
<br><br>
<br>The relationship set can also have some attributes.
<br>Example:

<br>Sometimes people are also interested in some information about relationships.
<br>In the “students borrow books” example, we also want to know when the book is borrowed, when the book is returned, and how long the book is kept by the student.
<br>This information does not belong to students or books. It is about the association.<br>
<img alt="Attribute-for-relationship-sets" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ER-Attribute-for-relationship-sets.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">


<br><br>
<br>In the previous example, the attribute duration is in a dashed ellipse because it is a derived attribute.

<br>If one knows the date of borrow and the date of return, then the duration can be calculated from the two values.

 <br><br>File System Interface

<br>File Concept 
<br>Access Methods 
<br>Disk and Directory Structure 
<br>File System Mounting 
<br>File Sharing 
<br>Protection

<br><br>What is File?

<br>A named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage. 

<br>(e.g. Disk, SSD, Flash, etc.)


<br>A sequence of bits, bytes, lines, or records

<br>the meaning of which is defined by the file’s creator


<br>Smallest logical storage unit for user view

<br>File Property

<br>Contiguous logical address space
<br>Represents programs or data

<br>File system resides on secondary storage (disks)

<br>Provides user interface to storage, mapping logical to physical.
<br>Provides efficient and convenient access to disk by allowing data to be stored, located, retrieved easily.

<br><br>File attributes 

<br>Name – only information kept in human-readable form
<br>Identifier – unique tag (number) identifies file within file system
<br>Type – needed for systems that support different types
<br>Location – pointer to file location on device
<br>Size – current file size
<br>Protection – controls who can do reading, writing, executing
<br>Time, date, and user identification – data for protection, security, and usage monitoring 

<br>
<br>Information about files metadata are kept in the directory structure, which is maintained on the disk
<br><br>Basic File Operations

<br>Create a file
<br>Write a file
<br>Read a file
<br>Reposition within a file
<br>Truncate a file<a data-footref="[inline0" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/about:blank#fn-1-09418c4b25513546" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a>

<br>File is reset to length zero 

<br>当一个文件被截断时，其内容被清空，文件的长度被重置为零。这意味着文件中原有的所有数据都将被删除。


<br>File space is released

<br>截断文件后释放的空间指的是之前文件内容所占用的存储空间被系统回收。这样可以提高存储效率，为其他文件或数据释放空间。


<br>File attributes are unchanged

<br>尽管文件的内容和大小发生了改变，文件的属性（如修改时间、访问权限等）保持不变。这意味着文件的元数据，除了与文件大小相关的部分，不会因为截断操作而受到影响。




<br>Delete a file

<br>
Except file creation and deletion, all other operations need to open the file first and then close the file after the operation
<br><br>
<br>Lock of file is provided by some operating systems
<br>Similar to reader writer locks
<br>Two Kinds of Lock
Shared lock

<br>Similar to reader lock
<br>Several processes can acquire concurrently 

Exclusive lock

<br>Similar to writer lock
<br>Mandatory lock 

<br>Once a process acquires an exclusive lock, the operating system will prevent any other process from accessing the locked file

<br>Windows




<br>Advisory lock

<br>it is up to software developers to ensure that locks are appropriately acquired and released

<br>Unix/Linux





<br><br>The OS uses the extension to indicate the type of the file.<br>Most common types 

<br>.c 
<br>.exe 
<br>.docx 
<br>.pdf 
<br>.jpg 
<br>.png 
<br>.zip

<br><br>
<br>Sequential Access
<br>Direct/Random Access
<br>Access Methods

<br>Sequential Access

<br>Commands

<br>read_next 
<br>write_next 
<br>reset (to the beginning)  




<br>Direct/Random Access

<br>Commands 

<br>read next 
<br>write next 
<br>read n 
<br>write n 
<br>position to n 
<br>rewrite n





n = an index relative to the beginning of the file

<br>Index and Relative Files

<br>Keep index in memory for fast determination of location of data to be operated on 

<br>E.g., VMS OS





<br><br><br>A directory structure (per file system) is used to organize the files<br>Both the directory structure and the files reside on disk<br><br>
<br>Drive 驱动器
<br>Partition 分区
<br>Volume 卷
<br><br>
<br>A drive is a physical block disk.
<br>A drive can be subdivided into several logic block disks (partitions)
<br><br>
<br>Disk or partition can be used raw

<br>i.e., without a file system 


<br>Partition can be formatted with a file system (cooked)

<br>Root partition contains the OS kernel, and other system files
<br>Other partitions can hold other OSes, other file systems, or be raw.


<br><br>
<br>A volume is a single accessible storage area with a single file system, a volume can contain multiple partitions
<br><br>
<br>General-purpose file systems 

<br>Mostly used, like Windows


<br>Special-purpose file systems

<br>Solaris’s contract file system


<br> Basic operations

<br>Search for a file 
<br>Create a file 
<br>Delete a file 
<br>List a directory 
<br>Rename a file
<br>Traverse the file system

<br>The directory is organized logically to obtain<br>
<br>Efficient location of a files 
<br>Naming convenient to users

<br>Two files in different directories can have the same name 
<br>The same file can have several different names


<br>Grouping of files with similar properties

<br>put photos in a directory


<br><br>
<br>Single level directory
<br>Two-level directory 
<br>Tree-structured directories 
<br>Acyclic graph directories
<br><br>Tree structures is a tree of arbitrary height, mostly common directory structure <br>
<br>It allows users to create their own subdirectories and to organize their files accordingly.
<br>Advantages

<br>Efficient searching 
<br>Grouping capability


<br><br>
<br>A tree structure prohibits the sharing of files or directories. 
<br>An acyclic graph (a graph with no cycles) allows directories to share subdirectories and files 
<br>A file may have multiple different path names 
<br>Some OSes simply do not allow shared directories or links
<br> How do we guarantee no cycles?

<br>
Allow only links to file not subdirectories

<br>
Every time a new link is added, use a cycle detection algorithm to determine whether it is OK. Very expensive.


<br><br>
<br>A file system must be mounted before it can be accessed 
<br>An unmounted file system can be mounted at a mount point 
<br>The amount point must be an empty directory 

<br>i.e., original file system at the mount point must be removed if exists


<br><br>
<br>A file can be shared by multiple users 
<br>Access might be protected 
<br>The owner of a file is the user who can change attributes and grant access and who has the most control over the file.
<br>The group attribute defines a subset of users who can share access to the file § The owner and group IDs of a given file (or directory) are stored as part of file attributes

<br>User IDs identify users, allowing permissions and protections for a user
<br>Group IDs allow users to be in groups, permitting group access rights


<br><br>
<br>
When information is stored in a computer system, we want to keep it safe from physical damage (the issue of reliability) and improper access (the issue of protection)

<br>
File owner/creator should be able to control:

<br>what can be done
<br>by whom


<br>
Types of access

<br>Read: Read from the file.
<br>Write: Write or rewrite the file.
<br>Execute: Load the file into memory and execute it.
<br>Append: Write new information at the end of the file.
<br>Delete: Delete the file and free its space for possible reuse. 
<br>List: List the name and attributes of the file


<br>
Other operations, such as renaming, copying, and editing the file, are high levels, done through read, write access.

<br><br>
<br>Each file and directory has an access-control list (ACL) 
<br>lists user names and the types of access allowed for each user. 
<br>Three modes of access 

<br>Read (R),
<br>Write (W)
<br>Execute (X)


<br>The UNIX system defines three fields (owner, group, public) of three bits (RWX) 
<br>Three classes of users on Unix / Linux
<br>Three classes of users on Unix / Linux RWX creator <br>
<br>Owner access 7  111
<br>Group access  6  110
<br>Public access  1   001 
<br><br> Four implementation methods for remote file sharing

<br>Manually transferring files between machines via programs like ftp (file transfer protocol) 4 both anonymous and authenticated access
<br>Use a distributed fil system (DFS), in which remote directories are visible from a local machine 4 tighter integration between the machine
<br>The World Wide Web, is a reversion to the first. Use a browser to gain access to the remote files, and separate operations (essentially a wrapper for ftp) 4 anonymous access
<br>Cloud computing 4 delivers computing, storage, and even applications as a service across a network.

<br>
<br>
<br>截断文件的操作通常用于快速清空文件内容而不删除文件本身，这在需要保留文件但不需要其内容的场景中非常有用。例如，日志文件管理中，当日志文件达到一定大小需要被清空重写时，可以使用截断操作来实现。<a href="https://www.allenygy.vip/about:blank#fnref-1-09418c4b25513546" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>

 <br><br>
<br>Demand Paging 
<br>Copy-on-Write 
<br>Page Replacement 
<br>Allocation of Frames 
<br>Thrashing 
<br>Allocating Kernel Memory 
<br>Other Considerations
<br><br><br>Could bring a page into memory only when it is needed <br>Advantages:<br>
<br>Less I/O needed
<br>No unnecessary I/O 
<br>Less memory needed 
<br>Faster response 
<br>More users/processes
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Frame-allocation algorithm determines 

<br>How many frames to give each process 


<br>Page-replacement algorithm 

<br>Which frames to replace  Want lowest page-fault rate on both first access and re-access


<br><br>
<br>FIFO 
<br>Optimal 
<br>Least Recently Used (LRU) 
<br>Second chance 
<br>Enhanced second chance
<br><br>Rule <br>
<br>Replace the oldest one
<br>Implementation<br>
<br>OS maintains a circular queue of all pages 

<br>Page at head of the list: Oldest one
<br>Page at the tail: Recent arrival 


<br>When there is a page fault 

<br>Page at the head is removed
<br>New page added to the tail


<br><br>Belady’s Anomaly For some page-replacement algorithms, the page-fault rate may increase as the number of allocated frames increases.<br>Adding more frames might cause more page faults!<br><br>Replace the page that will not be used for longest period of reference string<br>Problem <br>
<br>Can’t read the future<br>
This method can only be used to measure how other algorithms are close to the optimal
<br><br>Replace page that has not been used in the most amount of time<br>
<br>LRU is a good algorithm and frequently used 
<br>LRU and OPT don’t have Belady’s Anomaly
<br><br>
<br>There is a global counter that increases by 1 whenever a page is referenced. Every page in the memory has its own counter 
<br>When a page is referenced, its counter is synchronized with the global counter 
<br>When a page needs to be replaced, find the page in the memory with the smallest value
<br>Disadvantage<br>
<br>Take O(n) time to search
<br><br>
<br>
Keep a stack of page numbers in a double link form:

<br>
When a page referenced: 

<br>move it to the top 
<br>Advantage 

<br>No search for replacement 


<br>Disadvantage 

<br>Each update of the stack might requires 6 pointers to be changed




<br><br>Usage of a reference bit <br>
<br>Associate each page with a reference bit, initial value 0 
<br>When a page is referenced, set the bit 1 
<br>When a page is needed to be replaced, find the ones with reference bit 0 if exist one
<br><br>Second-chance algorithm <br>
<br>Use a circular FIFO and reference bit for each page in memory 
<br>If page to be replaced has reference bit = 0 » replace it
<br>reference bit = 1 » set reference bit to 0 » search for the next page
<br><br>Improve algorithm by using reference bit and modify bit for each page in memory <br>
<br>i.e., an ordered pair (reference, modify) 
<br>All pages in memory fall into four classes<br>
<br>(0, 0) neither recently used not modified – best page to replace
<br>(0, 1) not recently used but modified – not quite as good, must write out before replacement
<br>(1, 0) recently used but clean – probably will be used again soon
<br>(1, 1) recently used and modified – probably will be used again soon and need to write out before replacement – worst page to replace
<br>When page replacement called for, replace page in lowest nonempty class in clock scheme <br>
<br>Disadvantage 

<br>Might need to search circular queue several times


<br><br>More strategies (algorithms) in improving the efficiency of page replacement <br>Page-buffering consideration <br>
<br>
Keep a pool of free frames always

<br>Whenever it is possible, select a victim to evict and add it to free pool  
<br>When convenient, evict the victim 
<br>When frame needed, read page into free frame 
<br>Advantage: Reduce time to find a free frame at a page fault


<br>
Expansion

<br>Keep a list of modified pages 

<br>Whenever the paging device is idle, write the modified page to the disk. Its modify bit is then reset to 0 


<br>Keep free frame contents intact （完整的，内容未被清除的） 

<br>Reduce penalty if wrong victim frame was selected 
<br>If the page is referenced again, no need to load from the disk




<br><br>For performance reason, each process needs minimum number of frames<br><br><br>
<br>Each process is allocated same number of frames
<br>Disadvantage

<br>Space waste for small process


<br><br>
<br>Allocate frames according to the size of a process
<br>Disadvantage

<br>Process size might be changed during the execution


<br><br>
<br>the ratio of frames depends on the combination of size and priority of a process 
<br>Replace the pages of process with lower priority
<br><br>If a process does not have “enough” frames in memory, the page-fault rate is very high<br>
<br>Replace page frequently 
<br>The replaced page might be used again 
<br>This leads to: 

<br>Low CPU utilization 
<br>Operating system keeps adding new process, trying to increase CPU utilization
<br>Things get worse -&gt; entering a bad cycle 
<br>Thrashing 

<br>A process is busy swapping pages in and out, instead of doing useful work.




<br> Solutions to thrashing

<br>Decrease the degree of multiprogramming
<br>Establish “acceptable” page-fault frequency (PFF) rate and use local replacement policy
<br>Install enough physical memory (hardware)
<br>Install faster hard disk

<br><br>
<br>If actual rate too low, process loses frame (we think too many frames assigned, remove some frames) 
<br>If actual rate too high, process gains frame
<br><br>
<br>Allocating memory for Kernel is different from the allocation of memory for user applications 
<br>Special features of kernel 

<br>Kernel requests memory for structures of varying sizes 

<br>Structure for PCB
<br>Structure for file descriptor 


<br>There are multiples instances for each structure

<br>there is a PCB for each process


<br>Memory needs to be contiguous


<br><br>
<br>Allocates memory from fixed-size segment consisting of physically  contiguous pages
<br>Power-of-2 allocator: memory allocated in units is sized as power of2, one smallest but bigger than requested size
<br>Advantage:<br>
<br>Unused chunks can be merged to a bigger one
<br><br>
<br>A cache 

<br>is used for unique kernel data structure
<br>consists of one or more slabs
<br>A slab is one or more physically contiguous pages

<br>Filled with same kind of objects – instantiations of the data structure, 
<br>Each object has two status: free and used




<br>If slab is full of used objects, next object is allocated from empty slab

<br>If no empty slabs, new slab allocated

<br>Background
<br>The Critical Section 临界区
<br>Synchronization Software 软件实现同步
<br>Synchronization Hardware 硬件实现同步
<br>Mutex Locks 互斥
<br>Semaphores 信号两
<br>Classic Problems of Synchronization 同步问题
<br>Monitors 管程
<br>Deadlock and Starvation 死锁与饥饿
<br><br>Processes can execute concurrently 进程并发地执行<br>
<br>May be interrupted at any time, partially completing execution.

<br>如当一个进程时间片用尽，被另一个进程切换


<br>Concurrent access to shared data may result in data inconsistency. 

<br>如果此时访问相同的数据，将导致数据不一致


<br>进程具有异步性。<br>
异步性：各并发执行的进程以及各自独立的、不可预知的速度向前推进。<br>To solve this problem, we need to make processes access the same data mutually exclusive 令进程互斥地访问相同数据来解决数据不一致的问题<br>Race condition:<br>
<br>Several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently
<br>Outcome depends on which order each access takes place.
<br><br>Critical section problem is to design a protocol that the processes can use to cooperate.<br>Critical Section

<br>The segment of code in a process that modifies shared variables, tables, files
<br>When one process is in critical section, other process should not enter their critical sections for these shared data. 互斥访问 

<br>一个时间段内只允许一个进程使用的资源称为临界资源。<br>
临界资源只能互斥的访问。<br>对临界资源的互斥访问，可以在逻辑上分成四部分：<br>
<br>Entry section 进入区

<br>Ask for Permission 申请权限


<br>Critical section 临界区

<br>Protect this Section


<br>Exit section 退出区

<br>Do sth in order to allow other process to enter critical  section 


<br>Reminder section 剩余区
<br>Process with critical section should follow the following steps 

<br>execute entry section to ask for permission
<br>then execute critical section
<br>execute exit section to allow other process to enter critical section
<br>then execute remainder section

<br>do {
	entry section
		critical section
	exit section 
		reminder section 
}
<br><br><br>Requirements to Critical Section Problem

<br>Mutual Exclusion 互斥访问（忙则等待）

<br>If process  is executing in its critical section, then no other processes can be executing in their critical sections.


<br>Progress 空闲让进

<br>If no process is executing in its critical section and if other processes want to enter critical section, one of them must be selected. They cannot be postponed indefinitely.


<br>Bounded Waiting 有限等待

<br>If a process has made a request to enter its critical section, then, before that request is granted, there is a bound to the times that others can enter critical section.



<br>Assumptions in the solution 

<br>Each process executes at a nonzero speed 
<br>No concerning relative speed of the n processes 
<br>The load and store machine-language instructions are atomic (that is, cannot be interrupted)

<br>为了实现对临界资源的互斥访问，同时保证系统整体性能，需要遵循以下原则:

<br>空闲让进。临界区空闲时，可以允许一个请求进入临界区的进程立即进入临界区:
<br>忙则等待。当已有进程进入临界区时，其他试图进入临界区的进程必须等待;
<br>有限等待。对请求访问的进程，应保证能在有限时间内进入临界区(保证不会饥饿)
<br>让权等待。当进程不能进入临界区时，应立即释放处理机，防止进程忙等待。(课件未提及)

<br><br>Solution to Critical Section Problem

<br>Can't Satisfy Progress 无法实现，空闲让进<br><br>
<br>在进入临界区前先检查其他进程是否进入临界区 

<br>如果存在进程进程进入临界区，则等待
<br>否则，标志自己进入临界区


<br>存在问题：当越过判断时发生进程切换，则无法互斥访问数据 违反忙则等待

<br>Mutual Exclusion： Yes 
<br>Progress： Yes
<br>Bounded waiting： Yes
<br><br>Software-based solutions are not guaranteed to work on modern computer architecture<br>Many systems provide hardware support for implementing the critical section code.<br>Modern machines provide special atomic hardware instructions<br>
Atomic = non-interruptible，the atomic hardware instruction will do the following work<br><br>Uniprocessors -  could disable interrupts  单处理器 禁止中断 实现<br>
Currently running code would execute without preemption<br>
<br>Too inefficient 
<br>Advantage &amp; Disadvantage
Advantage:

<br>简单

Disadvantage:

<br>不适用于多处理机
<br>只适用于操作系统内核进程，不适用于用户进程

<br>因为开/关中断指令只能运行在内核态，这组指令不能让用户随意使用



<br><br>Use the idea of locking<br>
<br>Protecting critical regions via locks
<br>A process that wants to enter the critical section must first get the lock.
<br>If the lock is already acquired by another process, the process will wait until the lock becomes available.<br>

<br>Solution to Critical-section Problem Using Locks
do {
	acquire lock; // Entry section
	critical section;
	release lock; // Exit Section 
	reminder section;
}while(true);

Semaphore is a synchronization tool more sophisticated than mutex locks 

<br>用户进程可以通过使用操作系统提供的一对原语来对信号量进行操作，从而很方便的实现了进程互斥、进程同步。 

<br>从而很方便的实现了进程互斥、进程同步。



信号量其实就是一个变量(可以是一个整数，也可以是更复杂的记录型变量)，可以用一个信号量来表示系统中某种资源的数量

<br>比如:系统中只有一台打印机，就可以设置一个初值为1的信号量

原语是一种特殊的程序段，其执行只能一气呵成，不可被中断。原语是由关中断/开中断指令实现的。 软件解决方案的主要问题是由 “进入区的各种操作无法一气呵成”，因此如果能把进入区、退出区的操作都用“原语”实现，使这些操作能“一气呵成”就能避免问题。

<br>一对原语:wait(s)原语和signal(s)原语，可以把原语理解为我们自己写的函数，函数名分别为wait和signal，括号里的信号量S其实就是函数调用时传入的一个参数。
<br>Wait、signal 原语常简称为P、V操作(来自荷兰语proberen和verhogen)。

<br><br>Deadlock - Processes wait for each other<br>Starvation – indefinite blocking 
A process may never be removed from the semaphore queue in which it is suspended
<br>Priority Inversion – Scheduling problem when lower-priority
Process holds a lock needed by higher-priority process
<br><br>Priority Inversion Example Explained:

<br>Process Priorities and Resource Requirement:

<br>Assume three processes: , , and  with priorities .
<br>Process  requires a resource  which is currently held by process .


<br>Scenario Development:

<br>Process  must wait for  to finish using the resource  because  has it locked.
<br>However, process  becomes runnable and, due to its higher priority compared to , it preempts .


<br>Consequence of Priority Inversion:

<br>Process  (with middle priority) has affected how long process  must wait for  to relinquish resource .
<br>Even though  does not need , its operation delays  release of , thereby delaying  further, which is a clear instance of priority inversion.



<br>This situation shows how a lower-priority task (in this case ) can indirectly prevent a higher-priority task  from progressing by holding onto a needed resource longer due to the intervention of a medium-priority task (). This is problematic in real-time systems where such delays can lead to failures or missed deadlines. Solutions often involve using priority inheritance protocols where  would temporarily inherit  higher priority to avoid being preempted by , thus resolving the inversion more swiftly.<br>优先级反转示例解释：

<br>进程优先级和资源需求：

<br>假设有三个进程：、 和 ，它们的优先级依次为 。
<br>进程  需要一个资源 ，该资源当前由进程  持有。


<br>场景发展：

<br>进程  必须等待  完成使用资源 ，因为  正在锁定该资源。
<br>然而，进程  变为可运行状态，并由于其优先级高于 ，它抢占了 。


<br>优先级反转的后果：

<br>中等优先级的进程  影响了高优先级的进程  必须等待低优先级的  释放资源  的时间。
<br>尽管  不需要  资源，其操作延迟了  释放 ，进而延迟了 ，这就是一个典型的优先级反转的例子。



这种情况显示了一个低优先级任务（在这个例子中是 ）如何因为持有所需资源而间接阻止高优先级任务（）的进行，由于中优先级任务（）的介入使得  持有资源的时间延长。这在实时系统中是有问题的，因为这样的延迟可能导致故障或错过截止时间。解决方案通常涉及使用优先级继承协议，其中  会暂时继承  的更高优先级，以避免被  抢占，从而更快地解决反转问题。
<br>Solution:  Priority-Inheritance Protocol Explained:

<br>Protocol Basics:

<br>All processes accessing resources needed by a higher-priority process inherit the higher priority until they are finished with the resources in question.
<br>When these processes complete their tasks involving the resource, their priorities revert to their original values.


<br>Problem Resolution:

<br>By allowing lower-priority processes (like process  in the earlier example) to inherit the higher priority of a blocked higher-priority process (like process ), the system reduces the chance that a medium-priority process (like process ) will preempt them.
<br>This inheritance ensures that the lower-priority process can complete its use of the resource more quickly, thereby freeing up the resource for the higher-priority process.


<br>Effectiveness:

<br>This protocol effectively resolves the problem where a lower-priority process blocks a higher-priority one by holding a needed resource, as seen in the previous examples.
<br>It reduces the wait time for high-priority processes, ensuring they can proceed with minimal delay, thus adhering more closely to their intended scheduling priorities.



<br>优先级继承协议

<br>在优先级继承协议中，当一个低优先级进程使用一个高优先级进程所需的资源时，低优先级进程的优先级会被临时提升到高优先级进程的级别。
<br>这样做的目的是防止中等或其他低优先级的进程在此期间抢占资源，从而允许低优先级进程更快地完成对资源的使用并释放它，这样高优先级的进程就可以不受延迟地访问所需的资源。

Using Multiprogramming<br>CPU-I/O Burst Cycle

<br>横轴表示CPU Burst时间  

<br>

<br>短CPU突发：大多数进程都会有大量的短时间CPU突发，这表示进程在执行较短时间的计算后就会等待I/O操作。
<br>长CPU突发：只有少数进程会有较长时间的CPU突发，这些通常是计算密集型的进程，在执行更长时间的计算之后才会进行I/O操作。 

<br><br>The CPU scheduler selects a process from the processes in ready queue , and allocates the CPU to it  

<br>Ready queue 就绪队列 may be ordered in various ways

<br>switches from running to waiting state (non-preemptive自愿 )

<br>Example: the process does an I/O system call.


<br>switches from running to ready state (preemptive 非自愿)

<br>Example: there is a clock interrupt.


<br>switches from waiting to ready (preemptive)

<br>Example: there is a hard disk controller interrupt because the I/O is finished.


<br>terminates (non-preemptive)

<br>Preemptive vs. Nonpreemptive Scheduling

<br>When a process is pre-empted, 当进程非自愿离开CPU

<br>It is moved from its current processor
<br>However, it still remains in memory and in ready queue 仍保留在就绪队列


<br>When a process is non-preemptive 当进程自愿离开CPU

<br>Process runs until completion or until they yield control of a processor 进程运行直至完成或让出处理器控制权
<br>Disadvantage: Unimportant processes can block important ones indefinitely

<br>进程易阻塞





<br>Why preemptive scheduling is used?

<br>Improve response times 
<br>Create interactive environments (real-time)

<br><br>Concept

<br>Throughput: number of processes that complete their execution per time unit吞吐量 
<br>Response Time: amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is produced, not output (for time-sharing environment) 等待时间-进程在就绪队列中等待的总时间
<br>Turnaround Time: amount of time to execute a particular process (from start to end of process, including waiting time) 执行特定流程的时间(从流程的开始到结束，包括等待时间)

<br> 是第n个CPU突发的预测时间（基于过去的观测）。 
<br> 是一个介于0和1之间的权重，用来平衡最近的实际CPU突发时间和之前的预测。<br>


<br><br>Scheduling Algorithm
The preemptive version of SJF is also called shortest-remaining-time-first 

<br>Preemption: If a new process arrives in the ready queue while a current process is executing, the remaining time to complete the current process is compared with the total time required by the new process to finish. If the new process requires less time than what the current process has left, the current process is preempted (put back in the ready queue) and the CPU is given to the new process.
<br>Efficiency: This algorithm is effective in terms of average waiting time and turnaround time. By giving preference to processes that are closest to completion, it minimizes the amount of time each process has to wait to complete its execution.
<br>Starvation: A potential downside of SRTF is that longer processes may suffer starvation; if shorter processes keep arriving, the longer processes may be postponed indefinitely.
<br>Dynamic: Unlike SJF, which is static and decides on a process before it starts executing, SRTF has to make decisions dynamically as new processes arrive and as the remaining execution times of the processes in the ready queue change.

<br><br>SRTF Example

<br><br>Multilevel Queue

<br>Ready queue is partitioned into separate queues, e.g.:

<br>Foreground (interactive processes) 
<br>Background (batch processes)


<br>Process permanently in a given queue (stay in that queue) Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm:

<br>Foreground – RR 
<br>Background – FCFS 


<br>Scheduling must be done between the queues:

<br>Fixed priority scheduling 

<br>Each queue has a given priority

<br>High priority queue is served before low priority queue
<br>Possibility of starvation 




<br>Time slice 

<br>Each queue gets a certain amount of CPU time

<br><br>Multilevel Feedback Queue

<br>A process can move between the various queues; 

<br>aging can be considered in this way (prevent starvation) 
<br>advantage: prevent 


<br>The multilevel feedback queue scheduler 

<br>the most general CPU scheduling algorithm 
<br>defined by the following parameters: 

<br>number of queues
<br>scheduling algorithms for each queue 
<br>Policies on moving process between queues 

<br>when to upgrade a processes 
<br>when to demote 降级 a processes 
<br>which queue a process will enter when that process needs service







<br>Example of Multilevel Feedback Queue
Three queues: FCFS+RR

<br> – RR with time quantum 8 milliseconds
<br> – RR with time quantum 16 milliseconds
<br> – FCFS<br>

<br>Scheduling

<br>A new job enters queue  which is served FCFS 
<br>When it gains CPU, job receives 8 milliseconds 
<br>If it does not finish in 8 milliseconds, job is moved to queue   
<br>At  job is again served FCFS and receives 16 additional milliseconds 
<br>If it still does not complete, it is preempted and moved to queue  where it runs until completion but with a low priority

<br><br>Distinguish between user-level and kernel-level threads<br>

When threads are supported by kernel,   threads are scheduled, not processes<br>
当内核支持线程时，内核调度的是线程，而不是进程
Example
Many-to-one and many-to-many models,

<br>Thread library schedules user-level threads to run on kernel threads (LWP: light-weight process)

Typically priority is set by programmer 优先级人为设置

Kernel threads are scheduled by Kernel onto available CPU 内核线程被可利用的CPU调度

<br>Solution： 每个核都有多个硬件线程<br>
<br>Each core has more than one hardware threads. If one thread has a memory stall, switch to another thread!
<br><br>Chip-multithreading  CMT assigns each core multiple hardware threads. <br>
<br>(Intel refers to this as hyper-threading.)
<br>On a quad-core system (4核) with 2 hardware threads per core, the operating system sees 8 logical processors.<br>Abstract
在一个四核（4核）系统中，如果每个核心支持2个硬件线程，操作系统看到的8个逻辑处理器其实是由这种硬件线程技术（也称为超线程技术）使得每个物理核心能够同时处理两个线程。这种技术允许CPU更高效地利用其资源，特别是在某些核心的一部分资源（如执行单元）在特定时刻未被充分使用时。<br>
具体来说，超线程技术通过使每个物理核心在操作系统层面呈现为两个逻辑处理器来工作。这样，操作系统和应用程序可以将这些逻辑处理器视为独立的处理单元，从而在逻辑上扩展了CPU的并行处理能力。<br>
因此，在这样一个四核处理器中，由于每个核心可以处理两个线程，总共就有(4 \times 2 = 8)个逻辑处理器。这就是操作系统为什么会看到8个逻辑处理器的原因。这种安排使得处理器在处理多任务或多线程应用程序时更为高效，尤其是在等待I/O操作或进行其他非CPU密集型任务时，可以更好地利用CPU资源。
<br>Two levels of scheduling: 可以在两个层次调度 Multithreaded Multicore System<br>
<br>The operating system deciding which software thread to run on a logical CPU OS决定谁进CPU(逻辑上)
<br>Each core decides which hardware thread to run on the physical core Core 决定谁进入物理核心
<br><br>Load balancing
Load balancing attempts to keep workload evenly distributed 

<br>Push migration – periodic task checks load on each processor, and pushes tasks from overloaded CPU to other less loaded CPUs 
<br>Pull migration – idle CPUs pulls waiting tasks from busy CPU

<br>Push and pull migration need not be mutually exclusive  推迁移、拉迁移不必相互互斥<br>
<br>They are often implemented in parallel on load-balancing systems.
<br><br>处理器亲和性指的是线程或进程倾向于在被分配运行的同一个CPU上运行的性质。 当线程在一个处理器上运行时，它的数据会被存储在该处理器的高速缓存（cache）中。如果这个线程之后继续在同一个处理器上运行，它可以更快地访问之前的数据，因为数据已经在缓存中了。<br>Load balancing may affect processor affinity<br>
<br>
A thread may be moved from one processor to another to balance loads

<br>
That thread loses the contents of what it had in the cache of the processor it was moved off

<br>
Soft affinity软亲和性：操作系统会尽量让线程在同一个处理器上运行，但不保证。系统负载均衡器可能会根据需要将线程迁移到其他处理器。<br>


<br>
Hard affinity应亲和性：进程可以指定它希望运行的处理器集合。如果设置了硬亲和性，即使在负载高的情况下，内核也不会将进程移动到它未指定运行的处理器上。

<br><br>NUMA and CPU Scheduling
在NUMA架构中，计算机的内存被分割成多个区域，每个CPU都有一块局部内存。这些内存区域之间的访问速度可能不一样：<br>
局部内存（Local memory）：与某个CPU相邻的内存，这个CPU访问局部内存的速度快（fast access）。<br>
非局部内存（Non-local memory）：不与该CPU相邻的内存，该CPU访问非局部内存的速度慢（slow access）。<br>
NUMA-aware操作系统在调度线程到CPU时会考虑内存访问的非一致性。它会尝试将线程分配到可以快速访问所需数据的CPU上。这意味着操作系统会考虑线程正在使用的数据的内存位置，并尽量让线程在靠近这些数据的CPU上运行。<br>
这样做的好处是减少了内存访问延迟，提高了处理速度。但是，如果线程被调度到远离其数据的CPU上，它访问内存的速度将会慢下来，这可能会降低性能。<br>

<br><br>Why Real-Time CPU Scheduling? 
  实时CPU调度（Real-Time CPU Scheduling）是一种操作系统的调度机制，它确保能够满足实时任务的时间要求。实时操作系统（RTOS）通常需要这种调度策略，因为它们运行着要求在特定时间内完成或响应的任务。
<br>Two kinds of RTOS

<br>Soft real-time systems 尽可能在截止时间内完成任务

<br>Critical real-time tasks have the highest priority, but no guarantee as to when tasks will be scheduled (best try only) 


<br>Hard real-time systems 严格在截止时间前完成任务

<br>a task must be serviced by its deadline (guarantee)



<br><br>Event latency 

<br>the amount of time that elapses from when an event occurs to when it is serviced.

<br>Two kinds of Event Latency

<br>Interrupt latency 中断延迟– time from arrival of interrupt to start of kernel interrupt service routine (ISR) that services interrupt 

<br><img alt="Interrupt Latency" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/InterruptLatency.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">


<br>Dispatch latency 调度延迟 – time for scheduler to take current process off CPU and switch to another

<img alt="Windows Scheduling" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/WindowsScheduling.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br>
Windows操作系统中进程可以属于六种优先级类别，每个类别中各个相对优先级的数值。Windows API定义了实时类（real-time class）和变量类（variable class），每个类别中都有不同的优先级级别。

<br>
在实时类别中，有一个时间关键（time-critical）优先级，这是最高的优先级，数值为31。其他优先级依次降低，直到最低的空闲（idle）优先级，数值为16。这些优先级是为需要即时响应的任务设计的，比如那些在特定时间限制内必须完成的任务。

<br>
在变量类别中，优先级从高（high）到空闲（idle）不等。每个优先级类别还有相对优先级，如正常（normal）类别的优先级数值范围从15到6不等。这些优先级通常用于普通应用程序和后台任务。

<br>
“变量”（Variable 意味着线程的优先级可以改变，即使它们属于同一类别。这允许操作系统根据当前的需求和资源情况动态调整进程的优先级。

<br>
在调度时，系统会选择优先级数值最高的线程来执行，确保时间敏感的任务能够获得及时的处理。通过这种方式，操作系统可以管理多任务环境中的资源分配，确保关键任务能够及时完成，同时为不太重要的任务提供必要的CPU时间。

 <br><br><br><br>What is Threads?
 A thread is a single sequence stream within a process.
<br>Threads Property
The threads of a process share resources at any given time.<br>
Resources including

<br>executable code 
<br>the values of its variables code section, data section, OS resources

<br>What thread can do?
Most modern applications are multi-threaded 

<br>Kernels are generally multi-threaded

Multiple tasks in an application can be implemented by separate threads

<br>Example: The following tasks can do in an application:

<br>Update display
<br>Fetch data
<br>Spell checking 
<br>Answer a network request 



<br>Advantage of Threads

<br>Economy 

<br>Process creation: heavy-weight
<br>Thread creation: light-weight	


<br>Resource Sharing
<br>Efficiency 

<br>Can simplify code


<br>Responsiveness

<br>May allow continued execution if part of process is blocked 
<br>即使进程的部分被阻塞，仍可以继续运行


<br>Scalability

<br>Process can take advantage of multicore architectures, with one or two threads per core



<br>Disadvantage of Threads
More difficult to program with threads<br>
New categories of bug are possible
<br>Similarities
Threads vs. Processes

<br>Threads share CPU and only one thread active (running) at a time. 在一个进程中
<br>Threads within a processes execute sequentially. 
<br>Thread can create children. 
<br>If one thread is blocked, another thread can run.

<br>Difference

<br>A thread is a component of a process 
<br>Multiple threads can exist within one process.
<br>Multiple threads execute concurrently and share resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources.

<br><br><br>Multi-core or multi-processor systems putting pressure on programmers <br>Challenges include:<br>
<br>Dividing activities 
<br>Load Balance Data splitting 
<br>Data dependency 
<br>Testing and debugging
<br><br>What is Concurrency ? 并发

<br>More than one task are progressing
<br>Single processor / core, CPU scheduler providing concurrency by doing context switches
<br>两个事件或多个事件在同一时间间隔内发生。事件在宏观上同时发生，但微观上是交替发生的<br>

<br>What is Parallelism ? 并行

<br>More than one task are progressing
<br>Single processor / core, CPU scheduler providing concurrency by doing context switches 
<br>指两个或者多个事件在同一时刻同时发生<br>
<img alt="Parallelism" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Parallelism.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br>Type of Parallelism

<br>Data parallelism – distributes subsets of the same data across multiple cores, same operation on each

<br>Example: when doing image processing, two cores can each process half of the image
<br><img alt="Data Parallelism" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Data-Parallelism.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">


<br>Task parallelism – distributing threads across cores, each thread performing unique operation

<br>Example: when doing sound processing, the sound data can move through each core in sequence, with each core doing a different kind of sound processing (filtering, echo, etc.)

<br>Parallelism implies concurrency, but concurrency does not imply parallelism.<br><br>Amdahl's Law
Identifies performance gains from adding additional cores to an application that has both serial and parallel components<br>
它是用来估计在给定部分程序能够并行化的前提下，多处理器系统相比于单处理器系统在执行该程序时能达到的最大加速比。<br>
 

<br> 是系统性能的提升倍数。
<br>S is serial portion 串行部分
<br> processing cores是处理器的数量。

<br>Proof:

<br>S is serial portion, P is parallel portion of program.<br>
So S + P = = 1 
<br>Assume that running time on one core: 
<br>Then running time on N cores:  <br>
(≥, not =, because of extra communication required between threads.)
<br>Therefore,   

<br><br>Gustafson's Law
Gustafson's law addresses the shortcomings of Amdahl’s law<br>
It is based on the assumption of a fixed problem size<br>
: theoretical scaled speedup of the program with parallelism.<br>
N,S,P: meanings are same as in Amdahl algorithm.
<br>Summary
 Gustafson's Law强调了随着问题规模的增加，可以实现更高的并行度<br>
Amdahl's Law则强调了并行计算的理论上限。两者都在并行计算领域提供了重要的视角。
<br><br><br>User Threads
Management<a data-footref="[inline0" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/about:blank#fn-1-09418c4b25513546" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a> done by user-level threads library.
<br>Advantages
No need for OS support<br>
Works even on very old or very simple OS that does not have system calls for thread management.<br>
No system call required<br>
Fast: only need a library function call.
<br>Disadvantages

<br>A process with only one thread gets as much CPU time as a process with many threads. 分配不合理
<br>All the thread scheduling inside a process must be done at user level (not done by kernel)

<br>Each thread must be nice and cooperate with the other threads in the process and regularly give CPU time to the other threads.
<br>Program more complicated to write.



<br><br>Kernel Threads
Management<a data-footref="[inline1" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/about:blank#fn-2-09418c4b25513546" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a> supported by the kernel<br>
Kernel Threads  是处理机分配的单位
<br>Advantages
Kernel knows how many threads each process contains so it can give more CPU time to the processes with many threads. Kernel更好分配任务

<br>No need for threads to cooperate for scheduling

<br>Thread scheduling done automatically by kernel
<br>User program simpler to write.



<br>Disadvantages
Every thread management operation requires a system call<br>
Slower compared to user-level threads.<br>
Kernel’s PCB data structures more complex<br>
- The kernel needs to keep track of both processes and threads inside processes.
<br><br>
<br>Many-to-One
<br>One-to-One
<br>Many-to-Many
<br><br>Many-To-One

<br>Many user-level threads mapped to single kernel thread.
<br>One thread blocking (waiting for something) causes all threads to block (because their common kernel thread is blocked). 
<br>Multiple threads may not run in parallel on multicore system because only one may be in kernel at a time.
<br>Examples: 1. Solaris Green Threads 2. GNU Portable Threads

<br>Few systems currently use this model.<br><br>One-To-One

<br>Each user-level thread maps to kernel thread.
<br>Creating a user-level thread creates a kernel thread.
<br>More concurrency than many-to-one.
<br>Number of threads per process sometimes restricted due to overhead.<br>

需要在用户态和内核态切换，开销大

<br>
<br>Windows and Linux use this model 
<br><br>Many-To-Many

<br>Allows many user level threads to be mapped to many kernel threads.
<br>Allows the operating system to create a sufficient number of kernel threads.
<br>Example: Windows with the ThreadFiber package. Otherwise not very common.<br>

<br><br>What is Threads Library?
Thread library provides programmer with API for creating and managing threads
<br>Two primary ways of implementation
 Library entirely in user space (user threads only)<br>
OS-level library supported by the kernel (user threads mapped to kernel threads, with one-to-one model for example).
<br>Three primary thread libraries:

<br>POSIX Pthreads
<br>Windows threads
<br>Java threads

<br><br>Pthreads
May be provided either as user-level or kernel-level<br>
A POSIX standard (IEEE 1003.1c) API for thread creation and synchronization<br>
- Specification, not implementation<br>
- API specifies behavior of the thread library, implementation is up to developers of the library<br>
Common in UNIX operating systems (Linux &amp; Mac OS X)
<br><br>Implicit Threading
Implicit threading是一种编程方法，其中并行性是由编译器、运行时系统或其他并行编程框架自动管理的，而不是由程序员显式控制。

<br><br>Thread Pools
Create a number of threads in advance in a pool where they await work

<br>Advantages:

<br>Usually slightly faster to service a request with an existing thread than create a new thread 
<br>Allows the number of threads in the application(s) to be bound to the size of the pool 
<br>Separating task to be performed from mechanics of creating task allows different strategies for running task


<br>Windows API supports thread pools:
<br>Available in Java as well

<br>
<br>
初始化：创建一个线程池，指定线程数量，通常基于可用的CPU核心数。

<br>
任务提交：任务提交给线程池，而不是直接提交给某个线程。这些任务通常保持在一个队列中。

<br>
任务执行：线程池中的空闲线程从队列中提取任务并执行。一旦线程完成了任务，它就可以用于另一个任务。

<br>
优势：这样可以避免为每个任务创建和销毁线程的开销，这种开销可能很大。它还允许更好地控制活跃线程的数量，防止系统因为太多并发线程而过载。

<br>
使用场景：线程池被用于服务器应用程序处理多个客户端连接，在工作队列管理中，以及任何任务可能成批出现并需要由限定数量的工作人员处理的情况。

<br>线程池是隐式线程的一种形式，因为程序员不直接管理线程生命周期或任务到线程的分配。相反，他们使用池和任务的更高级别抽象，而底层实现处理线程管理的细节。<br><br>Fork-Join Parallelism
Multiple threads (tasks) are forked, and then joined.<br>
-  Available in Java. （since Java SE7)<br>
- Similar to Hadoop MapReduce operation

<br><img alt="Fork-Join Parallelism" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Fork-Join-Parallelism.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br>Explain Fork-Join  Parallelism
Fork-Join并行模型是一种实现并行处理的编程模式，特别适合于可以递归分解为更小问题的任务。这个模式通常是通过一种显式的方式使用的，但由于其高级的抽象性，它在某些上下文中也可以被看作是隐式线程的一种形式。
Fork-Join模型解释：
在Fork-Join模型中，主要的思想是将一个大的任务分解（Fork）成若干个小任务，这些小任务可以并行处理，处理完毕后再将结果合并（Join）起来。这种模型特别适合处理可以递归分解的问题，比如快速排序、归并排序、图像处理等。
Fork-Join并行模式通常在编程中通过特定的库（如Java中的java.util.concurrent库）来实现，这些库提供了创建任务、同步、以及合并结果的API。程序员需要明确地创建任务，并指定任务之间的分解和合并逻辑。
为什么Fork-Join有时候被看作隐式线程：
虽然Fork-Join模型通常需要程序员明确指定任务的拆分和合并，但是在一些现代编程框架中，如Java的Fork/Join框架，程序员不需要直接管理线程，而是通过高层次的任务（比如RecursiveAction和RecursiveTask）来表达并行逻辑。这些任务被提交到一个可以管理这些任务并自动处理线程分配和同步的线程池。在这个意义上，尽管Fork-Join模型需要程序员做一些并行设计，但线程的具体管理是由框架隐式完成的，所以可以认为这有隐式线程的特征。
<br><br>OpenMP
Set of compiler directives and an API for C, C++, FORTRAN<br>
Provides support for parallel programming in shared-memory environments<br>
Identifies parallel regions – blocks of code that can run in parallel
<br>Explain OpenMP
OpenMP（Open Multi-Processing）是一个支持多平台共享内存并行编程的应用程序接口（API），其目的是为高性能计算提供一个便捷的方式来编写多线程的应用程序。它定义了一系列编译器指令、运行时库调用和环境变量，这些可以被用来指定高级别的并行性，无需程序员直接管理线程。
主要特点：

<br>
跨平台：OpenMP可以在包括UNIX和Windows操作系统在内的多种平台上使用。

<br>
简易性：通过编译器指令（通常称为pragma），程序员可以轻松地将串行代码并行化。例如，在C/C++中，一个简单的#pragma omp parallel就能够将代码块内的指令并行执行。

<br>
灵活性：OpenMP允许程序员详细控制线程行为，例如分配和管理数据，以及优化并行执行的性能。

<br>
可扩展性：OpenMP可以根据可用的处理器核心数自动调整并行任务的数量。


如何工作：

<br>
并行区域：使用#pragma omp parallel创建并行区域，该区域内的代码将被多个线程并行执行。

<br>
循环并行化：对于迭代计算，可以使用#pragma omp for或#pragma omp parallel for指令来分配循环迭代给不同的线程。

<br>
任务并行化：OpenMP 3.0及以后的版本支持任务并行，允许程序创建可以独立于循环并行化的异步任务。

<br>
同步机制：OpenMP提供了多种同步机制，如屏障（#pragma omp barrier）、临界区（#pragma omp critical）和原子操作（#pragma omp atomic），用以控制线程间的执行顺序和数据访问。

<br>
数据环境：可以使用#pragma omp指令的子句来管理数据的作用域（共享或私有）。


OpenMP是一个成熟的API，被广泛应用于科学计算、工程模拟和数据分析等领域。由于它提供了一种高层次的抽象，并能自动处理许多与线程管理相关的复杂性，因此可以认为它在某种程度上提供了隐式线程管理。即使是在并行区域中，大部分的线程管理和同步工作都是自动完成的，使得开发者可以专注于算法的并行化，而不必深入底层的线程管理细节。
<br><br>TLS

<br>Thread-local storage (TLS) allows each thread to have its own copy of data
<br>Useful when you do not have control over the thread creation process (i.e., when using a thread pool) 
<br>Different from local variables  Local variables visible only during single function invocation

<br>TLS visible across function invocations Similar to static data 
<br>TLS is unique to each thread



Linux declare a TLS variable:
_ _thread int number;

<br><br>Thread Concellation
Terminating a thread before it has finished Thread to be canceled is target thread Two general approaches:

<br>
Asynchronous cancellation terminates the target thread immediately异步取消会立即终止目标线程

<br>
Deferred cancellation allows the target thread to periodically check if it should be cancelled 延迟取消允许目标线程定期检查是否应该取消


<br>Abstract
Invoking thread cancellation requests cancellation, but actual cancellation depends on thread state<br>
<img alt="Thread-state" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Thread-state.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
If thread has cancellation disabled, cancellation remains pending until thread enables it<br>
Default type is deferred

<br>Cancellation only occurs when thread reaches cancellation point

<br>i.e. pthread_testcancel()
<br>Then cleanup handler is invoked



<br>Windows Threads

<br>Windows API – primary API for Windows applications 
<br>Implements the one-to-one mapping, kernel-level 
<br>Each thread contains 

<br>A thread id

 <br><br><br>Process

<br>a program in execution in memory
<br>execution must progress in sequential fashion

<br>There can be several process for one program<br>

<br>heap containing memory dynamically allocated during run time
<br>program counter, processor registers (include all current )

<br><br>

<br><br>PCB

<br>PCB: Information associated with each process, can be stored in a struct type also called task control block
<br>A PCB is a kernel data structure  PCB 是内核的数据结构
<br>Each process has a corresponding unique PCB in the kernel PCB 是进程的唯一标志

<br>PCB Include

<br>Process state – running, waiting, etc. State
<br>Program counter – location of instruction to next execute PC
<br>CPU registers – contents of all process-centric registers Register
<br>CPU scheduling information- priorities, scheduling queue pointers 
<br>Memory-management information – memory allocated to the process 
<br>Accounting information – CPU used, clock time elapsed since start, time limits 
<br>I/O status information – I/O devices allocated to process, list of open files

<br> A PCB is a kernel data structure

<br>stored in the memory reserved for the kernel
<br>invisible to the process itself 
<br>changed only by the kernel.

<br>Each process has a corresponding unique PCB in the kernel. 

<br>When a new process is created, the kernel creates a new PCB for it.
<br>When a process dies, the kernel deletes the process’s PCB.

<br>All the PCBs together is how the kernel keeps track of which processes exist in memory, where they are in memory, what they are currently doing (Maybe State )<br>
<img alt="ReadyQueue" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/StateQueue.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Threads
If process has a single thread of execution 

<br>One program counter 

If a process has multiple threads of execution 

<br>Kernel will keep the control information for each thread 
<br>Multiple program counters

<br><br><br>
<br>Several processes want to use one CPU (or CPU core) 
<br>Process scheduler 调度 (algorithm inside the kernel, software) selects among available processes（i.e. in ready state） for next execution on CPU core 

<br>Maintains scheduling queues of processes

<br>Ready queue – set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute


<br>Wait queues – set of processes waiting for an event (i.e. I/O) 


<br>Processes migrate among the various queues
<br>Scheduling purpose: maximize CPU use, quickly switch processes
<br><br>A context switch occurs when the CPU switches from one process to another.<br>
<img alt="CPU Switch From Process to Process" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/CPUSwitch.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>When CPU switches to another process, the system must 保护现场

<br>save the state of the old process (the one is running on CPU)
<br>load the saved state (CPU registers, program counter in PCB) for the new process (the one will run on CPU) via a context switch (i.e., switch PCB)


<br>Context-switch time is
 overhead

<br>the system does no useful work while switching 

  dependent on the complexity of OS

<br>The more complex the OS and the PCB， the longer time the context switch 

 dependent on hardware support

<br>some hardware provides multiple sets of registers per CPU  multiple contexts loaded at once, (no need to switch  context when load another process to run)

<br><br>OS must provide mechanisms for: 
Process Creation<br>
Process Termination
<br><br>Parent process <br>
<br>Create children processes 
<br>In turn create other processes,
<br>Finally forming a tree of processes<br>
Generally, process is identified and managed via a process identifier (pid)
<br>Parent and children <br>
<br>Resource sharing options

<br>

<br>Parent and children share all resources  全共享


<br>

<br>Children share subset of parent’s resources 子进程共享父进程的资源


<br>

<br>Parent and child share no resources 不共享




<br>Execution options 

<br>

<br>Parent and children execute concurrently `同时执行


<br>

<br>Parent waits until children terminate 父进程等待子进程销毁后执行




<br><br>
<br>Child process asks OS to terminate itself

<br>using the exit() system call.

<br>Returns status data from child to parent (via wait()) 
<br>Process’ resources are deallocated by operating system




<br>Parent may terminate the execution of children processes 

<br>using abort() system call for some reasons:

<br>Child has exceeded allocated resources
<br>Task assigned to child is no longer required
<br>Parent terminated (some OS do not allow children to be alive)




<br>Cascading 倾泻式的 termination 

<br>Some operating systems do not allow child to exist if its parent has terminated.
<br>When parent is terminated, all children, grandchildren, etc. are terminated. 
<br>The termination is initiated by the operating system.

<br>wait()system call <br>
<br>The parent process may wait for termination of a child process 
<br>The call returns status information and the pid of the terminated process
<br><br>Zombie Process 僵尸
A zombie process is  living corpse, half alive and half dead<br>
terminated, but still consumes system resources<br>
-  still has an entry in the process table<br>
- where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status.<br>
- once the exit status is read by parent via the wait system call, the zombie's entry is removed from the process table ("reaped“).
<br>Zombie Program 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
int main(){
	pid_t pid = fork(); 
	if (pid == 0) { /* Child */
		printf("Running Child, PID = %d\n", getpid());	
		exit(0); 
	} 	
	else {	
		printf("Terminating Parent, PID = %d\n", getpid());
		while (1) ; /* Infinite loop */
	} 
     return 0;
}

子程序结束却并未通过wait()回收
<br>Reaping 回收 
Performed by parent on terminated child<br>
Parent is given exit status information (by OS)<br>
Kernel discards process
<br> What if parent doesn’t reap?
 If any parent terminates without reaping a child, then child will be reaped by init or system process<br>
So, only explicitly reaping is needed when parent is a long- running processes. e.g., shells and servers
<br>orphan  process 孤儿
An orphan  process is child process that is still running  but parent process has finished or terminated.
<br>Orphan Program
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<br><br>Processes communicate through a shared memory<br><br>Producer process produces information that is consumed by a consumer process<br>
<br>Unbounded-buffer: no practical limit on the size of the buffer 

<br>Producer never has to wait because there is always extra space available for new information;
<br>Only consumer might have to wait if no information is available to read


<br>Bounded-buffer: buffer size is fixed Achieved by 循环队列

<br><br>Two operations message size is either fixed or variable<br>
<br>send(message)
<br>receive(message)<br>
A communication link between processes must be created before communication.
<br> Implementation of communication link 

<br>Physical level: 

<br>Shared memory 
<br>Hardware bus 
<br>Network


<br>Logical level: 

<br>Direct (process to process) or indirect (mail box)
<br>Synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous (non-blocking) 
<br>Automatic or explicit buffering



<br><br>In Direct Communication, Processes must name each other explicitly.<br>
<br>Send() and receive() primitives 原语 are defined as 

<br>send (P, message) – send a message to process P 
<br>receive(Q, message) – receive a message from process Q


<br>Properties of communication link 
Links are established automatically<br>
A link is associated with exactly one pair of communicating processes<br>
Between each pair there exists exactly one link<br>
The link may be unidirectional, but is usually bi-directional
<br><br>MailBox
Messages are directed and received from mailboxes (also referred to as ports 端口)

<br>Each mailbox has a unique id 

<br>Processes can communicate only if they share a mailbox
<br>Processes can communicate only if they share a mailbox


<br>The send() and receive() primitives are defined as 

<br>send(A, message) – send a message to mailbox A 
<br>receive(A, message) – receive a message from mailbox A



<br> MailBox  Operations 

<br>Create a new mailbox (port) 
<br>Send and receive messages through mailbox 
<br>Destroy a mailbox

<br>Properties of communication link

<br>Link established only if processes share a common mailbox 
<br>A link may be associated with many processes 
<br>Each pair of processes may share several communication links 
<br>Link may be unidirectional or bi-directional

<br><br>Message passing may be either blocking or non-blocking<br>Blocking is considered synchronous 同步

<br>Blocking send 

<br>the sender is blocked until the message is received by the receiving process or by the mailbox 


<br>Blocking receive 

<br>the receiver is blocked until a message is available



<br> Non-blocking is considered asynchronous 异步 

<br>Non-blocking send 

<br>the sender sends the message and continues without waiting for the message to be received 


<br>Non-blocking receive 

<br>the receiver receives:  A valid message, or Null message



<br>Different combinations possible<br>
If both send and receive are blocking, this case is called rendezvous 会合<br>Queue of messages attached to the link, in kernel memory<br>
Implemented in one of three ways<br>
<br>Zero capacity – no messages are queued on a link.

<br>Sender must wait for receiver (rendezvous)


<br>Bounded capacity – finite length of n messages 

<br>Sender must wait if link full


<br>Unbounded capacity – infinite length 

<br>Sender never waits

<br>Typically, a parent process creates a pipe and uses it to communicate with a child process that it created.
<br>Named Pipes <br>
<br>can be accessed without a parent-child relationship.

<br>Ordinary Pipes allow communication in standard producer-consumer style 
<br>Producer writes to one end (the write-end of the pipe)

<br>Protection and Security 

<br>Protection

<br>Ensure that all access to system resources is controlled

<br>Avoid attack from outside the system




<br><br><br>CLI or command interpreter allows direct command entry.<br>
<br>Commands are sometimes implemented in kernel

<br>commands built-in 内建指令


<br>Commands are sometimes by systems program

<br>names of programs 程序名
<br>Advantage: adding new features doesn’t require modification of interpreter


<br><br>
<br>User-friendly

<br>desktop metaphor (象征) interface
<br>Icons represent files, programs, actions, etc.


<br>Invented at Xerox PARC (1970s)
<br>Many systems now include both CLI and GUI interfaces

<br>Microsoft Windows is GUI with CLI “cmd” shell 
<br>Apple Mac OS X is “Aqua” GUI interface with UNIX kernel underneath and shells available 
<br>Unix and Linux have CLI with optional GUI interfaces


<br><br><br>System calls provide an programming interface for programs to use services of operating systems.<br><br>
<br>Typically, application developers design programs according to an API rather than directly system calls.
<br>The API Application Programming Interface specifies a set of functions that are available to an application programmer.

<br>Common API

<br>Win32 API for Windows
<br>POSIX API for POSIX-based systems (including virtually all versions of UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS X)
<br>POSIX Portable Operating System Interface is – a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.
<br>Java API for the Java virtual machine (JVM)




<br><br>
<br>
The caller just needs to obey API know nothing about how the system call is implemented Most details of OS interface hidden from programmer by API

<br>
The system call interface invokes the intended system call in OS kernel and returns status of the system call and any return values

<br>
Each system call has a number (as index)

<br>
System-call interface maintains a table: indexed according to these numbers

<br><br>
<br>Three general methods

<br>Simplest/Fastest: pass the parameters in registers 

<br>缺点：寄存器不够大，限制传参数量


<br>Parameters stored in a block/table, in memory, and address of block passed as a parameter in a register.
<br>Parameters are pushed onto the stack by the program and off the stack by the operating system


<br><br>
<br>Process Control
<br>File Management
<br>Device Management
<br>Information maintenance
<br>Communications
<br>Protection
<br><img alt="System Calls" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/SystemCalls.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>
Standard C Library

<br>Contains functions which make system calls or do not make system calls makes programmers’ work much easier


<br>
Advantages of using Standard C Library

<br>It is simpler to call a function in a standard C library rather than to make a system call
<br>Portability

<br>Source code executed in one OS can be run in another OS




<br>
Advantages of using system Calls

<br>System calls are usually more powerful than functions from the Standard C Library

<br>Can create processes, share memory between processes, etc. These advanced features are not available in the Standard C Library.


<br>It’s a little bit faster than using a library function (since internally the library function uses a system call anyway).


<br><br>Subset  Superset<br>The C POSIX library was developed at the same time as the ANSI C standard. includes additional functions to those introduced in standard C<br><br>System programs provide a convenient environment for program development and execution. They can be divided into:<br>
<br>File manipulation 
<br>Status information sometimes stored in a file 
<br>Programming language support 
<br>Program loading and execution 
<br>Communications 
<br>Background services (e.g., launch OS, disk checking, daemons(守护进程)) 
<br>Application programs
<br>Most User's view of the operation system is <br>
<br>defined by system programs, not the actual system calls (for system or application programmers)
<br><br>
<br>
Apps compiled on one system usually are not executable on other operating systems

<br>Each operating system provides its own unique system calls


<br>
How can apps be used in multi-operating systems 

<br>Written in an interpreted language like Python, Ruby, and interpreter available on multiple operating systems解释性语言 
<br>Written in a language that includes a VM containing the running app (like Java) 包括虚拟机的语言
<br>Written in a standard language (like C), compiled separately on each operating system to run on each OS 标准语言


<br>
Application Binary Interface (ABI) is<br>
- about how different components of binary code can interface for a given operating system on a given architecture<br>
-  in low-level details<br>
定义了不同的二进制代码组件如何在特定操作系统和特定础础架构上进行交互的低级别细节。

<br><br>
<br>Early OSes in assembly language
<br>Then system programming languages like Algol, PL/1 
<br>Now high level language C, C++

<br>High-level language is easier to port to other hardware
<br>But slower 


<br>Actually usually a mix of languages<br>
<br>Lowest levels in assembly language
<br>Main body in C
<br>Systems programs in C, C++, scripting languages like PERL, Python, shell scripts
<br>Emulation can allow an OS to run on non-native hardware
<br><br>
<br>Various ways to structure ones 

<br>Simple structure – MS-DOS 
<br>More complex -- UNIX 
<br>Layered 
<br>Microkernel -Mach


<br><br>
<br>limited structuring (due to early hardware) 有限结构化
<br>The UNIX OS consists of two separable parts

<br>Systems programs
<br>The kernel

<br>Consists of everything below the system-call interface and above the physical hardware
<br>Provides the file system, CPU scheduling, memory management, and other operating-system functions;
<br>Consists of a large number of functions in one level




<br><br>
<br>Advantages for monolithic design

<br>High speed
<br>High efficiency


<br>Advantages for modular design

<br>changes in one component affect only that component, and no others
<br>Modules can be modified easily.


<br><br>
<br>The operating system is divided into a number of layers (levels)

<br>The bottom layer (layer 0), is the hardware. 
<br>The highest (layer N) is the user interface. 
<br>Each layer is built on top of lower layers 

<br>With modularity, each layer uses functions (operations) and services of only lower-level layers




<br>Advantage: Simplicity of construction and debugging.
<br>Disadvantages:<br>
- Hard to define each layer.<br>
- Poor performance.<br>

<br><br>Moves as much components from the kernel into user space<br>
<br>Mach<br>
Mac OS X kernel (Darwin) partly based on Mach
<br>Communication takes place between user modules using message passing<br>
<br>Microkernels provide minimal process and memory management, in addition to a communication facility.
<br>Communication between user modules through message passing.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Microkernels.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>Advantage<br>
<br>Easier to

<br>extend to a microkernel
<br>port the operating system to new architectures 


<br>More reliable (less code is running in kernel mode)
<br>More secure
<br>Disadvantages<br>
<br>Overhead of communication between user space and kernel space
<br><br>Many modern operating systems implement loadable kernel modules (best practice)<br>
<br>Uses object-oriented approach
<br>Each core component is separate, is loadable as needed within the kernel, talks to the others over known interfaces
<br>Overall, similar to layers but with more flexible<br>
E.g., Linux, Solaris, macOS, Windows, etc<br><br>Most modern operating systems: not one pure model (structure) <br>
<br>Hybrid combines multiple approaches to address performance, security, usability needs. 
<br>Example<br>
<br>Linux and Solaris kernels: monolithic (in kernel memory), plus modular (for dynamic loading of functionality)
<br>Windows mostly monolithic, plus microkernel for different subsystem personalities, also provide support for dynamically loadable kernel modules.
<br>Apple Mac OS X, Microkernel plus layered, Aqua (GUI) plus Cocoa (API) programming environment
<br><br>
<br>
When power is initialized on system, execution starts at a fixed memory location

<br>
Operating system must be made available to hardware so hardware can start it

<br>One step process 

<br>Small piece of code – bootstrap loader引导程序, BIOS基本输入输出系统 stored in ROM or EEPROM locates the kernel, loads it into memory, and starts it


<br>Two step process 

<br>ROM code loads boot block (with bootstrap loader) in hard disk
<br>Bootstrap loader loads kernel




<br>
Bootstrap loader 引导程序  -----simple code to initialize the system 

<br>Load Kernel 
<br>Starts system daemons 守护进程 (services provided outside of the kernel)

I/O设备与CPU并发工作

<br>这意味着CPU可以处理指令，同时I/O设备可以进行数据传输，它们不必等待彼此完成任务才开始工作。

<br>Controller

<br>每个I/O设备都通过一个控制器与系统总线连接。控制器负责管理与特定I/O设备的数据传输。
<br>例如，磁盘驱动器通过磁盘控制器连接，鼠标和键盘可能通过USB控制器连接。
<br>设备控制器负责管理特定设备的操作，并且每个控制器都有其自己的本地缓冲区。
<br>控制器确保数据正确无误地在设备和计算机的内存之间传输。

<br>Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type

<br>每个设备控制器被一个特定的设备控制

<br>Each device controller has a local buffer

<br>每个设备控制器都有一个本地缓存

<br>Local Buffer  本地缓冲区

<br>每个设备控制器都有一个本地缓冲区（或本地内存），用于临时存储从设备传输的数据或要传输到设备的数据。
<br>缓冲区可以平衡CPU和设备之间的速度差异，因为CPU通常比I/O设备快得多。

<br>System Bus
系统总线

<br>系统总线是连接CPU、内存和所有I/O设备控制器的通道。
<br>它允许数据在CPU、内存和I/O设备之间传输。

<br>I/O is between the device and local buffer of controller

<br>IO 发生在设备与控制器的缓冲区之间

<br>Memory
内存

<br>在图中，内存单独显示，表示它与CPU和所有I/O设备通过系统总线相连。
<br>内存用于存储CPU当前正在处理的数据和指令，以及等待被I/O设备处理的数据。

<br><br><br>CPU与Memory间的关系 可以分成三种模型<br>Single Processor &amp; Multiple Processor  单处理器 和 多处理器

<br>单处理器
<br>这是最基本的配置，有一个CPU负责处理所有计算任务。

<br>这个CPU有自己的寄存器和缓存来处理指令和数据。


<br>多处理器
<br>在这种配置中，有两个或更多的独立CPU或处理器 

<br>与单处理器相同每个CPU都有自己的寄存器和缓存。
<br>这些处理器共享主内存，允许它们处理更多的任务和并行计算。



<br>Dual Core 双核处理器

<br>双核处理器实际上是一个包含两个独立核心的单个CPU。

<br>每个核心都有自己的Regisiter和 L1 cache。
<br>它们共享一个二级缓存L2 cache和 Main Memory。
<br>这允许一个处理器在同一时间内处理更多的任务。



<br>NUMA  非统一内存访问系统

<br>NUMA是一种内存设计，其中多个处理器被分配专用的内存块。
<br>每个CPU可以访问自己的内存memory0, memory1,....，以及其他CPU的内存，但访问其他CPU的内存会有更高的延迟。
<br>这种设计可以提高处理器访问内存的速度和效率，特别是在处理大量数据或高性能计算任务时。

<br><br>What is Operating System ?
OS Include:

<br>Kernel Part of a operating system, resides in memory at all times on the computer<br>

<br>System programs -all programs associated with the operating system, but not in kernel 
<br>Application programs - all programs not associated with the operating system 
<br>Middleware中间件– a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers such as:  databases, multimedia, graphics



<br>Operating System Is Interrupt-Driven

<br>Device driver inside the kernel knows how to talk and manage the device<br>
在kernel中的设备驱动知道如何管理设备以及和设备交流
<br>Device driver provides uniform interface between controller and kernel<br>
设备驱动器为控制器和内核提供统一接口
<br>Each device controller informs CPU that it has finished its operation by causing an interrupt<br>
每个设备控制器通过中断告知CPU，它已经完成了它的操作<br>
The code of the kernel is in memory all the time but the code of the kernel is only executed when there is an interrupt, on demand!<br>
内核的代码一直在内存中，但内核的代码只有在出现中断时才会按需执行！<br>
<img alt="Device Driver In Kernel" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/DeviceDriverInKernel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br><br>Abstract

<br>当软硬件发生需要OS立刻处理的事件时中断发生

<br>在软件层面：由Error或者System call引起中断
<br>在硬件层面：由Device 引发


<br>由ISR决定对于不同中断应该采取什么行动

<br>Interrupt
An interrupt is a signal emitted by hardware or software when a process or an event needs immediate attention

<br>Software: A trap or exception is a software-generated interrupt caused either by an error or a user request (system call)
<br>Hardware: Device<br>
[!abstract] Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)<br>
ISR inside the kernel determine what action should be taken for each type of interrupt

<br><br>When there is an interrupt, the operating system
Preserves the state of the CPU 

<br>by storing registers and the program counter(PC) for the software that was just interrupted (so that the same software can be restarted later).

Determine type of interrupt

<br>check Interrupt vector to get the address of corresponding ISR for this interrupt (used on all modern computers)

Runs ISR in kernel to handle interrupt
<br><br><br>Direct Memory Access (DMA)
<img alt="DMA" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/DMA.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br>Device controller transfers blocks of data from buffer directly to main memory without CPU intervention, In the meantime the CPU can work on something else.


<br>DMA允许设备控制器直接将数据块从缓冲区传输到主内存，而不需要CPU干预。
<br>这样做的好处是CPU可以同时进行其他计算任务，而不需要管理这些数据传输。


<br>Only one interrupt is generated per block
<br>High transfer speed: not byte by byte, but block by block

<br><br><br>Timeline View
CPU

<br>CPU有两种状态，一种是执行用户程序，另一种是处理I/O中断。

I/O Device

<br>I/O设备的状态可以是空闲的或正在传输数据。

I/O Request

<br>当I/O设备准备好数据交换时，它会发出I/O请求。这通常发生在读取或写入操作开始时。

Interrupt

<br>当I/O设备完成数据传输时，它会发出中断信号给CPU。在图表中，这些中断用垂直的绿线表示。

<img alt="Timeline" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Interrupt-Driven-Timeline.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
Interrupt Dealing

<br>CPU在执行用户程序的过程中会接收到中断信号，然后切换到处理I/O中断的状态。这个过程中，CPU会停止当前的用户程序执行，保存必要的状态，并开始执行与中断处理相关的指令。

Transfer Done

<br>一旦中断处理完成，I/O设备会标记为传输完成，并准备接收下一个I/O请求。

User Program Done

<br>在I/O设备忙于传输数据（绿线下降部分）和CPU处理中断之间的时间，CPU会继续执行用户程序。

Red Circle

<br>图表中的红色圆圈可能代表一个特定事件或异常，例如一个处理延迟或一个需要特殊注意的中断。<br>
[!abstract]+<br>
总的来说，这个时间线展示了中断驱动I/O如何使CPU在等待I/O操作完成时可以继续其他任务，从而提高了系统的效率。<br>
当设备完成数据传输时，它通过中断通知CPU，CPU随后会处理该中断，并在处理完毕后恢复用户程序的执行。这种机制减少了CPU等待I/O操作的空闲时间。<br>
<img alt="WorkflowView" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Interrupt-Driven-WorkflowView.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br><br><br><img alt="TwoIOMethods" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/TwoIOMethods.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
这张图展示了中断驱动I/O周期的两种方法。<br>
在两种情况下，I/O操作都是由中断控制的，但是用户程序对I/O完成的处理方式不同。<br>
<br>Synchronous Method

<br>在这种方法中，用户程序启动I/O操作后，会一直等待直到I/O操作完成后才继续执行。这是一个同步I/O操作，因为用户程序在请求的I/O操作完成之前不会进行任何其他工作。
<br>用户程序进入等待状态，操作系统的设备驱动程序启动硬件操作，数据传输开始。
<br>一旦数据传输完成，中断处理程序（interrupt handler）会处理相应的中断，并控制权返回到用户程序，用户程序继续执行。 


<br>Example
想象你去银行取号等待办理业务。这个过程可以类比为一个计算机中的同步I/O操作。

<br>取号（启动I/O操作）:

<br>你走进银行，取一个号码，并等待你的号码被叫到。取号就像是一个程序请求I/O操作，比如从磁盘读取数据。


<br>等待（等待I/O完成）:

<br>取完号码后，你坐在等候区，不能离开，也不能做其他事情。你必须等待，直到银行工作人员叫到你的号码。在这个例子中，等待就像是程序在等待I/O操作完成。程序在这个等待期间不能执行其他任务，它被阻塞了。


<br>办理业务（处理I/O结果）:

<br>当你的号码被叫到，你前往柜台，开始与银行职员交谈，完成你的业务。这一部分对应于中断处理程序在I/O操作完成后运行，处理数据。


<br>返回（控制权返回用户程序）:

<br>业务办理完成后，你离开银行，可能回家或者去做其他事情。这就像是控制权从I/O操作返回到用户程序，用户程序继续执行其它任务。<br>
在这个同步I/O操作的例子中，你（用户程序）在整个等待过程中无法进行其他活动。你必须等待直到被叫号（I/O操作完成），这样可能导致效率低下，因为你的时间被完全占据在等待过程中，无法同时进行多个任务。这就是同步I/O可能引发的性能问题，尤其是在处理长时间的I/O操作时。



<br>
<br>Asynchronous Method

<br>在这种方法中，用户程序在启动I/O操作后不会等待I/O完成，而是立即继续执行其他工作。这是一个异步I/O操作，用户程序可以在I/O操作正在进行时做其他事情。
<br>用户程序发起I/O请求后，控制权立即返回，无需等待硬件操作完成。
<br>数据传输和中断处理会在后台进行，而用户程序在这个过程中可以继续执行其他任务。 


<br>Example
想象一下你在做饭，同时你想听音乐。你有一张CD和一个CD播放器（这里的CD播放器就像一个需要读取数据的I/O设备）。 

<br>启动播放器（请求I/O操作）:


<br>你把CD放入播放器并按下播放按钮。这一动作启动了播放器的内部机械装置去读取CD上的数据。


<br>继续做饭（用户程序继续执行）:

<br>一旦音乐开始播放，你不需要站在播放器旁边等待每首歌曲加载。相反，你可以继续做饭。这个阶段就像是服务器处理其他客户端请求或者进行其他工作。


<br>歌曲播放完毕（I/O操作完成）:

<br>当一首歌曲播放完毕，CD播放器会自动读取下一首歌曲。如果我们把这比喻成一个中断，那么每当一首歌播放完毕，播放器就“中断”当前状态，转而开始播放下一首歌。


<br>不需要干预:

<br>在整个过程中，你无需干预播放器的操作。你可以专注于做饭，而播放器在后台自行处理CD的播放。<br>
这就是一个日常生活中的异步I/O示例：你启动了一个需要时间完成的任务（CD播放），但在它完成之前，你可以去做别的事情（做饭），而不是等待它完成。当播放器需要你注意（比如CD播放完毕）时，它会以音乐停止的方式提醒你，这就好比是一个中断信号。



<br>这两种方法的选择取决于程序设计的需求。<br>
<br>同步I/O操作简单但可能效率较低，因为它会阻塞程序执行；
<br>异步I/O操作更复杂，但允许多任务同时进行，提高了效率。在多线程环境中，异步I/O特别有用，因为它允许程序在等待I/O完成的同时，继续在其他线程上工作。

<br>Operating system does a lot of management work

<br>Caching
<br>Process management
<br>Memory management

<br>I/O
<br>Protection and security


<br><br><br><img alt="Cache" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Cache.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>

Caching: Copy information from slower into faster storage system<br>
<img alt="TransferDirection" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/TransferDirection.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br>
Data access procedure: faster storage (cache) checked first

<br>Data exist, information is used directly from the cache (fast)
<br>Data not exist , data are copied from slower device to the faster.


<br>
Cache design consideration

<br>size
<br>content replacement policy


<br>
Cache coherency

<br>The coordination of the contents of caches such that an update to a value stored in one cache is immediately reflected in all other caches that hold that value


<br><img alt="CharacteristicsofVariousTypesofStorage" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/CharacteristicsofVariousTypesofStorage.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br><br>Program vs Process
A process is a program in execution

<br>Program is a passive entity, on storage
<br>Process is an active entity, in memory

<br>Process

<br>Creation, execution needs resources

<br>CPU, memory, I/O, files
<br>Initialization data


<br>Termination requires reclaim of any reusable resources

<br>
<br>Process can be single-threaded, or multi-threaded
<br>Each process has a program counter to specify location of next instruction to execute
<br><br>Multiprogramming VS Multitasking<br>
<br>
Multiprogramming : A subset of total jobs are kept in memory at the same time

<br>Job scheduling: choose which jobs to load into memory.

<br>When job has to wait (for I/O for example), OS switches to another job




<br>
Multitasking: The CPU switches jobs so frequently to increase interactions with users

<br>CPU scheduling: choose which job will run next If several jobs are ready to run at the same time


<br>

<br><br> Dual Mode<br><img alt="Dual Mode" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/OS/Dual-Mode.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>User Mode
<br>Kernel Mode
<br>Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and other system components<br>Dual Mode

<br>
用户模式（User mode）:

<br>当进程运行在用户模式下时，它被限制只能执行非特权指令。用户模式下的进程不能直接执行可能会影响系统整体操作的操作，比如访问硬件设备或者修改关键系统数据。


<br>
内核模式（Kernel mode）:

<br>当进程运行在内核模式下时，它可以执行任何CPU指令。这通常包括访问硬件设备和内存管理操作。只有操作系统核心部分的代码才能在内核模式下运行。


<br>
系统调用（System call）:

<br>当用户进程需要操作系统服务时（比如读取文件、创建进程等），它会执行一个系统调用。这通常通过执行一个特殊的指令（如trap）来实现，这会导致CPU从用户模式切换到内核模式。


<br>
模式位（Mode bit）:

<br>CPU使用一个模式位来指示当前是在用户模式还是内核模式下执行。用户模式的模式位为1，内核模式的模式位为0。


<br>
执行系统调用:

<br>一旦进入内核模式，操作系统的内核会接管控制权，执行系统调用所请求的服务。


<br>
返回用户模式:

<br>系统服务完成后，操作系统会将控制权返回给用户进程，并且将模式位设置回1，进程继续在用户模式下运行。

 <br><br><br>Lemma (Pumping Lemma)
If  is a regular language, then there is a positive constant  such that every string  of length at least  can be written as  satisfying the following conditions

<br>for each 
<br>, and
<br>.

<br>p is the pumping length.<br>Instead of proving the lemma formally, let's try to understand it.<br>Assume  is regular and  is the  which recognizes .<br>
Let  be the number of states in .<br>Assume  in  of length .<br>To accept ,  goes through a sequence of states <br>By pigeonhole principle, some states  appears multiple times in the sequence.<br>Assuming , the sequence of states can be <br><br>Then, it's trivial that , , ,  are all in .<br><br>The pumping lemma is used to prove a language is not regular.<br><br>To prove the language  is not regular <br>
<br>Assume that  is regular.
<br>Construct a string  of length .
<br>Show that no matter how  is split into , there is always an  such that  (contradiction).
<br><br>Theorem
 is not regular.
<br>Proof:<br>Assume  is regular. Let , which is a string in . By the pumping lemma,  is in the form . The substring  can be of the following three cases.<br>
<br>
If  only consists of 's, then  (pump  one more time) has more 's than 's. Thus, .

<br>
If  only consists of 's, same as case 1.

<br>
If  has both 's and 's, then 's and 's in  are intersecting with each other, which is not in the form of . Thus, .

<br>In summary,  can never be split into  such that  for all . Thus,  is not regular.<br>Here are some notes.<br>The pumping length  depends on the machine. Different machines have different pumping length.<br>But the pumping lemma is "machine independent". Thus you cannot assume the value of .<br>The condition  ensures that the substring being pumped is not empty.<br>
Otherwise, <br>The condition  ensures that  always can be pumped by a machine.<br>The pumping lemma is only a necessary condition for regular.<br>
It is not a sufficient condition.<br>
In other words, if you cannot find a  or such  does not exist to accomplish the proof, you CANNOT say the language is regular. <br><br><br>Answer: Not regular.<br>Proof:<br>Assume  is regular. Consider the string , where  is a prime number and  (where  is a constant from the pumping lemma). By definition, . <br>Since prime numbers are infinite,  is constructible for some . (This point is crucial because, if  were not constructible, the proof could not proceed.)<br>By the pumping lemma,  can be split into three substrings , where:<br>
<br>,
<br>,
<br> for all .
<br>Here,  consists of only 's. Assume . Then .<br>Now, consider the string  (i.e.,  for ):<br>
<br>Its length is .
<br>However,  is not a prime number, because  is a prime number, and  (where ) is an integer greater than 1.<br>Thus, , which contradicts the pumping lemma. Therefore,  is not regular.<br><br>Answer: Not regular.<br>Proof (Sketch):<br>We can express  as:<br>
<br>
<br>Here, , and  are regular languages.
<br>Regular languages are closed under set union and complement.
<br>If  were regular, then  would also be regular (by closure properties of regular languages).<br>
However, this contradicts the result from , where  was proven to be not regular.<br>
Thus,  is not regular.<br><br>Answer: Regular. In fact, .<br>Proof:<br>Consider :<br>
<br>
Case 0: If , then .

<br>
Case 1: If  is a prime, then .

<br>
Case 2: If  is composite, then , where each  is a prime and  is a positive integer constant.

<br>Next,  for all .
<br>Thus, .


<br>Thus, .<br><br>Answer: Regular. <br>
<br>.
<br> is regular.
<br><br>Answer: Not regular.<br>Proof (Sketch):<br>
<br>Consider the string .
<br>Then, .

A computation is a procedure to calculate the desired output of a computational problem.

<br>Turing machine
<br>这段历史概述了数学逻辑与计算机科学发展的几个关键人物及其贡献，涉及从17世纪到20世纪的重要理论基础。这些贡献共同构建了现代逻辑学、数学以及计算机科学的基础，以下是逐步的介绍：<br><br>莱布尼茨是一位德国哲学家、数学家，被认为是现代数学逻辑的奠基人之一。他的两项核心构想对后来的逻辑发展产生了深远影响：<br>
<br>Calculus ratiocinator（理性演算器）：一个假设性的通用逻辑计算框架，旨在通过数学和逻辑计算解决一切问题。
<br>Characteristica universalis（通用特征语言）：一种理想化的通用概念语言，试图以形式化的方式表达所有知识。这是莱布尼茨对人类知识进行逻辑编码的梦想，也是后来形式逻辑的前身。
<br>尽管莱布尼茨的构想在他在世时未能实现，但它为后来的逻辑学家提供了启发。<br><br><br>弗雷格是德国逻辑学家，被称为现代逻辑学的奠基人之一。他的主要贡献体现在：<br>
<br>Begriffsschrift（概念文字）：这是第一本关于符号逻辑的书，首次提出了一种形式化的逻辑语言，用以表达数学和逻辑推理。这一理论直接落实了莱布尼茨“理性演算器”的思想，是现代形式逻辑的起点。
<br>他还发展了谓词逻辑，为数学基础提供了更加严谨的框架。
<br>弗雷格的工作直接影响了后来的逻辑学家，包括罗素和维特根斯坦。<br><br><br>哥德尔是奥地利逻辑学家，以他的不完备性定理闻名，该定理对数学和逻辑的基础提出了深刻的限制：<br>
<br>不完备性定理指出：在任何包含自然数的公理系统中：

<br>存在一个无法被证明也无法被否定的命题（即“不可判定命题”）。
<br>这个系统无法证明自身的相容性。


<br>哥德尔的工作揭示了数学体系的固有局限性，破坏了希尔伯特“证明数学一致性”的乐观计划（Sabotaged Hilbert’s program）。
<br>哥德尔的理论对数理逻辑和理论计算机科学产生了重大影响。<br><br><br>丘奇是美国数学家，他的λ演算（Lambda Calculus）为计算理论奠定了重要基础：<br>
<br>λ演算是一种数学形式系统，用以研究函数定义和计算过程。它与图灵机被认为是等价的，提供了描述计算过程的一种抽象方法。
<br>丘奇证明了一些问题在形式系统中是不可判定的，这与哥德尔的结果相辅相成。
<br>λ演算后来成为编程语言理论的重要基础。<br><br><br>图灵是英国数学家、逻辑学家，被誉为计算机科学之父。他的贡献主要包括：<br>
<br>图灵机：一种假想的计算设备，旨在模拟任何可计算过程。这一模型定义了“可计算性”的概念，被认为是现代计算机的理论基础。
<br>图灵与哥德尔、丘奇的研究共同确立了计算理论的基本框架。
<br>图灵还提出了“图灵测试”，作为人工智能的早期概念。]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/theory-of-computation/lecture/01-toc-intro.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Theory Of Computation/Lecture/01-TOC-Intro.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 13:05:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[TOC-PDA]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br><br>Theorem	
Regular expressions are equivalent to finite automata.
<br>The proof has two steps.<br>
<br>The language defined by a regular expression can be recognized by a finite automaton.
<br>The conversion is also doable vice versa. 
<br>The conversion from a regular expression to an NFA is trivially ensured by the closure property .<br>
So, we only need to convert NFA to regular expressions.<br><br>The Conversion requires generalized NFA, which is a special type of NFA. <br>Only one start state and one final state.<br>
The start state is different from the final state.<br>
The transition function is <br>

<br>If the GNFA has only 2 states  and , then the label on the transition is the regular expression for the language.
<br>Thus, the conversion recursively merges states and transitions of the generalized NFA.

<br><br>In this lecture, we only emphasize several proving techniques.<br>
<br>Constructive proof 
<br>Prove by contradiction 
<br>Induction 
<br>Diagonal argument
<br><br>
<br>Used to prove a predicate with existential quantifiers, like .
<br>First, construct an object .
<br>Second, prove  is true.
<br><br>
<br>Used to prove a proposition .
<br>First, assume  is false.
<br>Then, derive a contradiction.
<br>Last, claim  is true.
<br><br>
<br>To prove a predicate with universal quantifiers, one can use induction.
<br>Induction has two variants: simple and strong. But, they are equivalent.
<br>To prove :
<br><br>
<br>Prove  as a base case.
<br>Prove  as an induction.
<br>In the second step,  is the inductive hypothesis.
<br><br>
<br>Prove  as a base case.
<br>Prove .
<br>We assume  are all true in the strong induction.
<br><br>Def: Cardinality
The cardinality of a set  is the number of objects in , denoted as .
<br>Def: Cardinality
The set  and the set  are of the same cardinality if there is a bijection .
<br><br>
<br> and  are of the same cardinality because we can define a bijection  such that .
<br>The set of even numbers  and the set of integers  are also of the same cardinality because of the bijection .
<br>Note that the cardinality can be finite and infinite.<br><br>Def: Countable
A set is countable if it is finite or its cardinality is same as the set of natural number .
<br>Countable means that:<br>
<br>For every number  in the natural number (no matter how large the number is),
<br>if we count from 0,
<br>we can eventually  reach the number  within a finite time.
<br>In fact, the counting procedure constructs a bijection, mapping a natural number  to the  counted element.<br>We denote the cardinality of  by <br>To proof an infinite set  is countable, you need t construct a bijection <br><br>Georg Cantor developed a method to prove a set is uncountable.  <br>For example:<br>Theorem  
The set of all real numbers in the open interval  is uncountable.
<br>The intuition of the proof (by contradiction) is as follows:<br>
<br>Assume  is countable, then we can "count" the numbers one by one.
<br>Then, we can list all the numbers that we count in a table.
<br>Construct a real number in  but cannot be reached in the table.
<br>Thus, the set of reals in  is uncountable.<br>Suppose we denote a real number as . Then, we build the table in Step 2 of the proof.<br><br>Next, we define a real number  such that:<br>
<br>We can see  is not in the list:<br>
<br> and  are different at digit 0.
<br> and  are different at digit 1.
<br>
<br>Thus,  is not counted, and the set of reals in  is uncountable.<br> Here we list some facts about infinite sets:<br>
<br>The set of real numbers  has cardinality .
<br>The power set  of  also has cardinality .
<br> has cardinality .
<br>You can make such constructions by taking power sets.
<br>Hypothesis (Continuum Hypothesis - CH)
There is no set of cardinality strictly between  and .
<br>So far, people only know:<br>Theorem (Cohen 1964)
CH is unprovable under ZFC.

 <br><br>The computation power of this model is rather weak. Because it can only use a limited (finite) memory. But it is also useful in some applications. <br><br>Deterministic finite automata 
A deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a 5-tuple   , where

<br> is a finite set called states,
<br> is a finite set called alphabet,
<br> is the transition function,
<br> is the start state (also called initial state), and 
<br> is the set of accept states (final states).

<br>The transition function  can also be represented as a transition table.<br>
The table has  rows and  columns.<br>
The value in each entry is a state.<br>
 is a total function. So, every entry has a value.<br>
The input of a DFA is a string in the language .<br>
The output of a DFA is only accept or reject.<br>Suppose  is a string in . The DFA  accepts  if and only if:<br>
      <br>Each  is a state of .<br>
Each  is a transition.<br>
 is a final state in .<br>The sequence of transitions can also be expressed as:<br>
<br>Remember, a DFA can be represented as a state graph. The features of the graph are listed:<br>
<br>A state is in a circle.
<br>A transition is an arc from the current state to the next state.
<br>The input symbol required by a transition is the label of the arc.
<br>The initial state is pointed by an arrow.
<br>Each final state is double circled.
<br>Example<br>Let  be a DFA, where the transition function  is:<br><br><br><br>If  is the set of all strings that  accepts, then:<br>

<br>;
<br> recognizes .
<br>   For example:<br>
<br>A language is regular if it is recognized by some DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton).<br><br>Nondeterministic finite automata .
An NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) is a 5-tuple , where:

<br> is the set of states;
<br> is the alphabet;
<br> is the transition function;
<br> is the start state; and
<br> is the set of final states.

<br>Suppose  is an NFA to recognize the language .<br>
<br>
If  is a string in the language :

<br>Then there exists a "way" to reach the final state;
<br>It's also possible to reach a non-final state.


<br>
But if  is not a string in the language :

<br>Then there is no way to reach the final state.


<br>Please pay attention to the quantifiers.<br><br>The difference between a DFA and an NFA is the transition function .<br>

<br>This difference allows:<br>
<br>One state to transition to zero, one, or multiple states by taking one input symbol.

DFA, NFA, and NFA with -moves are of the same computation power.
<br>For convenience, we denote the ordering on the power by , , , etc. Trivially,<br> Lemma

<br>Next, we only need to show .<br>It seems the content repeats the explanation for converting  to a DFA and introduces the concept of -closure more formally. Here's a summary in Markdown format for your reference:<br>The Intuition of the Proof:<br>
<br>For every , we can construct a DFA that recognizes the same language.
<br>This is equivalent to the process of converting an NFA to an equivalent DFA.
<br>Def:  -closure
Let  be an .<br>
The -closure of a state , denoted , is defined as:<br>

<br>
<br> represents the set of all states that can be reached starting from  only using -transitions.
<br>This closure includes  itself and any other states reachable via one or more -moves.
<br>Alternative Name: The -closure is sometimes referred to as the Kleene Star or Kleene Closure.
<br>Def:  of a Set of States
 Let  be a set of states for a given NFA. The -closure of , denoted , is:<br>

<br>This means the -closure of  is the union of the -closures of all individual states in .<br>
 is the set of states reachable from  using only -transitions.<br>Def: -Move of a Set of States:
Let  be a set of states, and let  be a symbol for a given NFA. The -move of , denoted , is:<br>

<br> This describes all the states reachable by:<br>
<br>First making an -transition from any state  in , and
<br>Then taking all -transitions from those resulting states.
<br>NOTE:  gives the set of states reachable by consuming the symbol .<br><br>Let  be an . We construct a DFA , where:<br>

 <br><br>Please describe the mechanism of DGIM. How the error bound is estimated? Is there a way to further reduce this error bound. Submit your response online within the allow time frame.<br>Mechanism<br>When a new bit comes in, drop the last (oldest) bucket if its end-time is prior to N time units before the current time.<br>2 cases: Current bit is 0 or 1<br>
If the current bit is 0:<br>
<br>no other changes are needed
<br>If the current bit is 1:<br>
<br>Create a new bucket of size 1, for just this bit.

<br>End timestamp = current time


<br>If there are now three buckets of size 1, combine the oldest two into a bucket of size 2
<br>If there are now three buckets of size 2, combine the oldest two into a bucket of size 4
<br>And so on …
<br>Solution<br>To reduce the error bound in the DGIM algorithm, consider this:<br>Instead of maintaining 1 or 2 of each size bucket, we allow either r-1 or r buckets (r &gt; 2)<br>
<br>Except for the largest size buckets; we can have any number between 1 and r of those

## 婴儿的名字

  

<br>每年，政府都会公布一万个最常见的婴儿名字和它们出现的频率，也就是同名婴儿的数量。有些名字有多种拼法，例如，John 和 Jon 本质上是相同的名字，但被当成了两个名字公布出来。给定两个列表，一个是名字及对应的频率，另一个是本质相同的名字对。设计一个算法打印出每个真实名字的实际频率。注意，如果 John 和 Jon 是相同的，并且 Jon 和 Johnny 相同，则 John 与 Johnny 也相同，即它们有传递和对称性。<br>在结果列表中，选择 字典序最小 的名字作为真实名字。<br>示例：<br>
输入：names = ["John(15)","Jon(12)","Chris(13)","Kris(4)","Christopher(19)"], synonyms = ["(Jon,John)","(John,Johnny)","(Chris,Kris)","(Chris,Christopher)"]

输出：["John(27)","Chris(36)"]

Insertion Time: To insert an element into an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="AVL" data-href="AVL" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/avl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AVL</a> tree, we perform a binary search to find the correct position for the new element and then possibly perform some rotations to maintain the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="AVL" data-href="AVL" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/avl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AVL</a> property. The time complexity of both these operations is ( O(log n) ) because the tree is balanced.

<br>
Building the Tree: If we insert ( n ) distinct integers into an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="AVL" data-href="AVL" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/avl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AVL</a> tree, each insert operation takes ( O(log n) ) time. Since there are ( n ) elements, the total time to build the tree is ( O(n log n) ).

In-order Traversal: Once the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="AVL" data-href="AVL" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/avl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AVL</a> tree is built, we can perform an in-order traversal to retrieve the elements in sorted order. An in-order traversal of a binary search tree visits the nodes in ascending order, which is what we want for sorting. The time complexity for in-order traversal is ( O(n) ), as each node is visited exactly once.

<br>
Total Time Complexity: The total time complexity of sorting an array using an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="AVL" data-href="AVL" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/avl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AVL</a> tree is the time to build the tree (( O(n log n) )) plus the time for the in-order traversal (( O(n) )). Hence, the overall time complexity is ( O(n log n) ).

<br>Therefore, we have shown that using an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="AVL" data-href="AVL" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/avl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AVL</a> tree to sort an array of distinct integers has a time complexity of ( O(n log n) ).<br><br>a.<br><br><br><br>
<br>( L = 16 ): Each leaf node can hold up to 16 records.
<br>( M = 171 ): Each internal node can have up to 171 children (170 keys + 1 extra pointer).

 <br><br><br>This lab report presents a digit classification task on image data using VGG-16 and ResNet-18 neural networks. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions, leveraging PyTorch for model development.<br><br>The dataset is divided into training, validation, and prediction sets:<br>
<br>Training Set: 7,000 samples for training the model.
<br>Validation Set: 35,000 samples for evaluating model performance.
<br>Prediction Set: 28,000 unlabeled samples for generating final predictions.
<br>The preprocessing steps include resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and one-hot encoding the labels.<br>Steps:<br>
<br>Load Data: The data is loaded from CSV files and divided into training and validation sets.
<br>One-Hot Encoding: Labels are converted to one-hot encoded vectors for multi-class classification.
<br>Normalization and Reshaping: Pixel values are normalized (divided by 255), and data is reshaped to fit the model’s input size (batch size, channel, height, width).
<br>This preprocessing ensures the data is ready for training the deep learning model, with correctly shaped tensors and normalized inputs for efficient learning.<br><br>A deep convolutional neural network model with 16 layers. It can be divided into two parts: feature extraction and classification. The feature extraction part consists of convolutional and pooling layers, while the classification part consists of fully connected layers.<br><br>Feature extraction involves stacking 5 VGG blocks.<br>And Each VGG block consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.<br><br>Extract Features:<br>self.features = nn.Sequential(
	# Block 1: 2Conv + 1MaxPool
    self.vgg_block(num_convs=2, in_channels=1, out_channels=64), # 1*224*224 -&gt; 64*112*112
	# Block 2: 2Conv + 1MaxPool
    self.vgg_block(num_convs=2, in_channels=64, out_channels=128), # 64*112*112 -&gt; 128*56*56
	# Block 3: 3Conv + 1MaxPool
    self.vgg_block(num_convs=3, in_channels=128, out_channels=256), # 128*56*56 -&gt; 256*28*28
    # Block 4: 3Conv + 1MaxPool
    self.vgg_block(num_convs=3, in_channels=256, out_channels=512), # 256*28*28 -&gt; 512*14*14
	# Block 5: 3Conv + 1MaxPool
    self.vgg_block(num_convs=3, in_channels=512, out_channels=512), # 512*14*14 -&gt; 512*7*7
)
<br>VGG Block:<br>def vgg_block(self, num_convs, in_channels, out_channels):
    layers = []
    for _ in range(num_convs): # (1 conv + 1 relu) * num_convs
       layers.append(nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels,
                                kernel_size=3, padding=1))
        layers.append(nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels))  # Batch Normalization
        layers.append(nn.ReLU(inplace=True))
        in_channels = out_channels
    layers.append(nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)) # 1 MaxPool
    return nn.Sequential(*layers)
<br><br>After feature extraction, the classifier fully connects the extracted features to output classes. The classifier consists of:<br>
<br>Two fully connected (linear) layers, each followed by ReLU activation.
<br>The final fully connected layer maps the outputs to 10 classes (assuming digit classification with 10 categories).
<br>self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(512 * 7 * 7, 4096), # 512*7*7 -&gt; 4096
    nn.ReLU(inplace=True), 
    nn.Linear(4096, 4096),  # 4096 -&gt; 4096
    nn.ReLU(inplace=True), 
    nn.Linear(4096, num_classes),   # 4096 -&gt; 10
)
<br><br>The forward method defines how data flows through the network:<br>
<br>Input passes through the feature extractor (self.features) consisting of VGG blocks.
<br>The output is flattened into a 1D tensor.
<br>Flattened data is passed through the classifier to produce the final output.
<br>def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)  # 5 VGG blocks
        x = torch.flatten(x, start_dim=1) # flatten
        x = self.classifier(x)  # 3 FC layers
        return x
<br><br>ResNet-18 is a deep neural network architecture designed with residual blocks to allow training of very deep networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem. This model can be divided into three main parts: preprocessing, residual feature extraction, and classification.<br><br>The preprocessing layer is the initial layer of ResNet-18, which prepares the input for deeper layers by reducing its size. This layer consists of:<br>
<br>A 7x7 convolutional layer with 64 output channels, stride of 2, and padding of 3, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
<br>A 3x3 max pooling layer with a stride of 2 for downsampling, resulting in reduced spatial dimensions.
<br>Preprocessing:<br>self.preprocess = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(in_channels, 64, kernel_size=7, stride=2, padding=3),  # 1x224x224 -&gt; 64x112x112
    nn.BatchNorm2d(64),  # Batch Normalization
    nn.ReLU(inplace=True),  # ReLU
    nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1)  # 64x112x112 -&gt; 64x56x56
)
<br><br>The Residual Block is the core building block of ResNet. It consists of two 3x3 convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. Additionally, the block has a shortcut connection that adds the input directly to the output of the convolutional layers, allowing the network to "skip" layers, which helps mitigate vanishing gradients.<br>
<br>Identity Mapping: If the number of input and output channels is the same, the input is directly added to the output.
<br>1x1 Convolution (Downsampling): When there is a change in dimensions or channel depth, a 1x1 convolution is used to match the dimensions before the addition operation.
<br>Residual Block:<br>class Residual(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, use_1x1conv=False, stride=1):
        super(Residual, self).__init__()
        # 3x3 Conv layer
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=stride, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        # 1x1 Conv layer for down-sampling
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=1, stride=stride, bias=False) if use_1x1conv else None

    def forward(self, x):
        identity = x  # Save the input for residual connection
        out = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))  # 3x3 Conv -&gt; BN -&gt; ReLU
        out = self.bn2(self.conv2(out))  # 3x3 Conv -&gt; BN
        # If the number of channels changes or the spatial dimensions change, use 1x1 Conv for down-sampling
        if self.conv3:
            identity = self.conv3(x)
        out += identity
        return F.relu(out)  # Apply ReLU activation at the end
<br><br>The feature extraction part is composed of four groups of residual blocks:<br>
<br>Each group has a specific number of output channels (64, 128, 256, 512).
<br>The stride of the first block in each group is set to downsample the spatial dimensions, while the subsequent blocks in the group maintain the spatial dimensions.
<br>Code for Residual Block Groups:<br>self.features = nn.Sequential(
    self.residual_block(64, 64, 2, stride=1),  # 64x56x56 -&gt; 64x56x56
    self.residual_block(64, 128, 2, stride=2),  # 64x56x56 -&gt; 128x28x28
    self.residual_block(128, 256, 2, stride=2),  # 128x28x28 -&gt; 256x14x14
    self.residual_block(256, 512, 2, stride=2),  # 256x14x14 -&gt; 512x7x7
)
<br><br>The classifier consists of:<br>
<br>An adaptive average pooling layer, which reduces the spatial dimensions to 1x1.
<br>A fully connected (linear) layer that maps the final features to the number of classes (10 in this case, assuming a digit classification task).
<br>Classifier:<br>self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
    nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1)),  # Adaptive average pooling layer
    nn.Flatten(),  # Flatten
    nn.Linear(512, num_classes)  # Fully connected layer
)
<br><br>The forward method defines the data flow through the ResNet model:<br>
<br>Input passes through the preprocessing layer.
<br>The result is then passed through the residual blocks.
<br>The output is pooled, flattened, and passed through the classifier to obtain the final predictions.
<br>Forward Pass Code:<br>def forward(self, x):
    x = self.preprocess(x)
    x = self.features(x)
    x = self.classifier(x)          
    return x
<br><br>The models were trained using the Adam optimizer and a categorical cross-entropy loss function. Training involved feeding augmented data batches through the network, optimizing weights iteratively.<br>optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train(train_loader, model, loss_fn, optimizer)
<br><br>After training, the models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess their performance on validation data.<br><br>Both VGG-16 and ResNet-18 performed well on the digit classification task, achieving accuracy above 96%. The key differences lie in training speed and computational efficiency:<br>
<br>
VGG-16: Achieved slightly higher accuracy (96.51%) but required longer training time due to its high parameter count, especially in fully connected layers. This makes it effective for tasks with moderate complexity, though it has a larger memory footprint.

<br>
ResNet-18: Trained faster due to its residual connections, which improve gradient flow and reduce the risk of vanishing gradients. Its architecture, with fewer parameters, is more memory-efficient, making it suitable for deeper networks or larger datasets.

<br>In summary, VGG-16 is advantageous when simplicity and interpretability are key, while ResNet-18 offers efficiency and scalability, especially useful in resource-constrained environments or for more complex tasks.<br><br><img alt="Visualization" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/00ftRr.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br><img alt="ResNet-18" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/Tvkhb6.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br><br><br><br>Xavier Initialization is designed to maintain the variance of activations across layers. It works well with layers that use sigmoid or tanh activations.<br>Formula:<br><br>where  is the number of input units, and  is the number of output units for the layer.<br>Usage: Applied to models where activation functions like tanh or sigmoid are used. It helps maintain the activation variance, avoiding issues with vanishing or exploding gradients.<br><br>Kaiming Initialization is tailored for layers with ReLU activations. It adjusts for the fact that ReLU outputs are zero for half the inputs, which can cause gradients to vanish if not handled properly.<br>Formula:<br><br>where  is the number of input units.<br>Usage: Commonly used in CNNs with ReLU layers, such as VGG and ResNet models. It preserves the variance of gradients, which helps maintain effective backpropagation in deep networks.<br><br>
<br>VGG-16 and ResNet-18 both benefit from Kaiming Initialization due to their reliance on ReLU activations.
<br>Xavier Initialization is an alternative when experiment with different activation functions, such as tanh.
<br>These initializations ensure effective gradient flow, improve convergence, and reduce the risk of vanishing or exploding gradients.<br><br><br>Batch Normalization normalizes inputs across a mini-batch, reducing internal covariate shift and helping to stabilize training. It is applied after convolutional layers in both VGG and ResNet models, accelerating convergence and improving gradient flow.<br>Formula:<br><br>Benefits: Reduces sensitivity to initialization, improves regularization, and stabilizes gradients.<br><br>Layer Normalization normalizes inputs across all features for each sample, independent of batch size.

 <br><br><br><br>I start by resizing the image to , which allows it to be divided cleanly into 256 blocks with shape   for DFT analysis.<br>   # Load the grayscale image

<br><br>According to the formula of 2D Fourier Transform<br><br>This formula transforms the spatial domain image   into the frequency domain representation   . It can be broken down into two main components:<br>
<br>Spatial Component    - the original image in the spatial domain. 
<br>Exponential Term  - the Fourier kernel, which captures the transformation from spatial coordinates  to frequency coordinates .
<br>This exponential term can be precomputed and stored in a 4D matrix to improve computational efficiency. By preprocessing and storing this kernel in memory, we can reuse it when calculating the DFT for each block of the image.<br><br>Take a  gray scales images as an example<br>For an image of size   , if you divide it into 256 blocks with shape , the precomputed kernel matrix will have the shape   . This kernel can then be used to calculate the DFT for all 256 blocks without recalculating the kernel for each one. This preprocessing is especially beneficial because it avoids repetitive computation and accelerates the DFT calculation across multiple blocks.<br><br>Since the similar expression between DFT and IDFT, we can also preprocess the IDFT kernel matrix in the same way.<br><br><br>Here is the code to preprocess the DFT and IDFT kernel matrices:<br>	def preprocess_dft_kernel(M, N):

LSH scales efficiently in high-dimensional spaces by hashing similar items into the same buckets, avoiding the curse of dimensionality that slows down exact methods. Unlike traditional hashing or exact algorithms, LSH offers a performance-accuracy trade-off that suits applications tolerant of approximate results.

 <br><br><br>Our project can mainly be divided into 3 phrases. The first part is Data collection, and the second part is construct the casual graphical model, finally according to the casual graphical model we want to using 2 methods to estimate the final result, first one is base on casual evaluation and the second one is based on the traditional machine learning method.<br><br><img alt="Data Collection" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/EWgs0t.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Our dataset would be collected from the movie comment website, such as Douban, Maoyan and IMDB.  And we could divide our data into 2 parts, the first part is the movie information which is structured data, such as the budget, cast, genres, release date, and the second part is the movie comments which is unstructured data.<br>For structured data,  we do not need to do much data preprocessing, but for unstructured data, we would need to do the following steps including: word segmentation, filter stop words including emotion bias words, statistical word frequency. Finally we get the high-frequency words and use them as the input of the casual graphical model.<br>High-frequency words are filtered through the upstream pre-trained word vector semantic space.<br><br><img alt="Construct Casual Graphical Model" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/xiMcZY.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>There are several methods to construct the casual graphical model, and we will try different methods to see which one is the best.<br><br>The constraints are based on the following conditions. For different V-structures, such as chain structure, folk structure and collider structure, they have different dependency properties, and the graph is built according to the dependency properties.<br><img alt="Inference" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/Inference.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>The algorithm begins by forming a complete undirected graph and eliminates edges based on unconditional independence. It then performs conditional independence tests, first using a single conditioning variable and then multiple conditioning variables. For each triple of variables , if  and  are connected, and  and  are connected, but  and  are not, the algorithm checks for a v-structure by testing if , indicating a collider structure. Next, orientation propagation is applied to direct edges. For each triple where  and  and  are not adjacent, the edge  is oriented as . This process continues to direct remaining undirected edges, refining the causal structure.<br><br>The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm extends the PC algorithm by accounting for latent confounders and selection bias. It begins by forming a complete undirected graph and progressively removes edges based on unconditional and conditional independence tests. Like the PC algorithm, FCI identifies v-structures, where unconnected variables exhibit a conditional dependence that suggests a collider relationship. The algorithm then applies orientation propagation to direct additional edges. What sets FCI apart is its ability to handle latent variables by identifying bidirected edges that indicate confounding factors and selection bias arrows. The final output is a Maximal Ancestral Graph (MAG), which captures the causal relationships, latent confounders, and selection bias effects, providing a comprehensive view of the underlying causal structure.<br><br>The Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm begins with an empty graph and iteratively adds edges to improve the fit based on a score, such as BIC or a Z score from hypothesis testing. After each addition, the graph is mapped to its Markov equivalence class. Once no further edges improve the score, GES removes edges, if doing so increases the fit, until no further improvements can be made. Although more complex than the PC algorithm, GES and PC converge to the same Markov equivalence class with large samples, but may yield different results with finite data. There is no GES equivalent for handling unknown confounders.<br><br><img alt="Training Model &amp; Evaluation" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/TmYWnl.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>After constructing the causal graphical model, the next phase involves leveraging it to estimate the box office performance of movies. This will be done using two distinct methods: causal evaluation and traditional machine learning models. By comparing these two approaches, we aim to determine which method provides more accurate predictions and better insights into the causal relationships between variables.<br><br>Using the constructed causal graphical model, we will employ causal inference techniques to evaluate the impact of different factors on box office success. Causal inference goes beyond correlation by identifying true cause-and-effect relationships, which can be highly valuable in decision-making, such as optimizing budgets, marketing strategies, or cast selection.<br>Steps:<br>
<br>Intervention Analysis (Do-Calculus): This involves simulating interventions on key variables (e.g., increasing marketing budget, selecting a high-profile cast) to observe their direct impact on box office performance. By analyzing these interventions, we can make informed recommendations on which variables should be adjusted to improve outcomes.
<br>Counterfactual Analysis: After predicting the box office outcome, we can analyze what-if scenarios. For instance, “What if a different actor was cast?” or “What if the budget was reduced by 20%?” Counterfactuals help in understanding alternative outcomes under different conditions, providing deeper insights for decision-making.
<br>Identification of Confounding Factors: Using the causal graphical model, we can identify and address confounders—variables that might obscure the true relationships between the input features and the target (box office). This allows for more accurate predictions by isolating the true effects of variables.
<br><br>The second method involves building traditional machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting models. These models will predict box office performance based on the same data used to construct the causal model, including structured data (e.g., budget, release date) and features extracted from unstructured data (e.g., sentiment analysis from movie comments).<br>Steps:<br>
<br>
Feature Engineering: For structured data, features such as budget, genres, and cast will be used directly. For unstructured data, sentiment analysis and topic modeling on movie reviews and comments will provide insights into audience perception, which can be highly predictive of box office performance.

<br>
Model Selection: Different machine learning algorithms will be tested and compared. These models will be trained on a portion of the data and validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure generalizability.

<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Both the causal inference model and the machine learning models will be evaluated using standard metrics, including: Mean Absolute Error (), Root Mean Squared Error (), R-Squared ()

<br>These metrics will help in comparing the performance of the causal inference and traditional machine learning models.<br><br>The research in the field of movie box office prediction has integrated various data sources such as metadata, online comments, and social media, and employed various machine learning methods. With the development of causal inference and causal graphical models, box office prediction is no longer merely dependent on correlations between variables but can identify the true influencing factors through causal analysis. These studies provide more tools and methods for future movie box office predictions, aiding investors in making better decisions with limited resources.<br><br>]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/data-analysis/big-data-analysis/peoject/bda-survey.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Data Analysis/Big Data Analysis/Peoject/BDA-Survey.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:23:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/EWgs0t.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/EWgs0t.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[BDA-Pre]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>u is an ancestor of v, if and only if  contains  .
<br>u is unrelated to v, if and only if  and  are disjoint intervals.

<br><img alt="Time-Stamp-1" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DAA/DFS/Time-Stamp-Structure-1.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Proof 
The idea is to consider every case.<br>
Assume   wlog.

<br>If  , then

<br>u is discovered when v is still not finished y et ( marked gray)  u is a descendant of v ;
<br>u is discovered later than v   u should finish before v;
<br>hence we have  is a subinterval of .


<br>If , then

<br>Obviously  and $[d[v] , f[v]] are disjoint;
<br>Which means that when u or v is discovered, the others are not marked gray; 
<br>And hence neither vertex is a descendant of the other



<br><br>Theorem
An edge in an undirected graph is either a tree edge or a back edge.
<br>Proof 
Assume . Then, v is be discovered while u is gray.<br>
Hence v is in the DFS subtree rooted at u.

<br>If ,   is a tree edge.
<br>If ,   is a back edge.

<br><br><br>Def: Articulation 
Let  G=(V, E) be a connected undirected graph.<br>
An articulation point (cut vertex) of G is a vertex whose removal disconnects G<br>
<img align="center" style="zoom:40%;" alt="Articulation" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DAA/DFS/Articulation-point.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>Given a connected graph G, how to find all articulation points?

<br>Brute Force Solution 
<br>

<br><br>
<br>Remove a vertex and its corresponding edges one by one one from G.
<br>Test whether the resulting graph is still connected or not say by DFS.
<br>The running time is O (n ∗(n + e)) .<br><br>
<br>The root of the DFS tree is an articulation point if it has two or more children.
<br>A leaf of the DFS tree is not an articulation point.
<br>And for other internal vertex v in the DFS tree, v is an articulation point if<br>
if there is one subtree rooted at a child of v that does not have a back edge which climbs higher than v.
<br><br>Def: Low and high
Using the discovery time in the DFS tree to define low and high.
<br>If there is a subtree rooted at a children of v which does not have a back edge connecting to a vertex with discovery time smaller than d[v] , then v is an articulation point.<br>
<br>Let Low (w) be the smallest value that a descendant of w can climb up by a back edge.
<br>We use d[v] to express the “hight” of v.
<br>v is “higher” than u if v and u are on the same branch of the DFS tree and d[v] &lt; d[u] .
<br>If v and u are on different branches, d[v] and d[u] are not compatible by the time-stamp structure.

<br>This documentation was written in a Markdown file.
<br>In my code, it can output all optimal solutions, both on the screen and to an output file.
<br>The number of integers in the input is unknown. You can input an array of arbitrary size.<br>
Here's a refined version of the guideline section of your documentation:
<br><br>The implementation was performed using standard C and compiled with the GCC compiler.<br><br>
<br>
Directory Structure<br>
To compile the code, ensure you are in the correct directory.  If you are in the correct path, you could see the following file tree structure:
.
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── in
├── in_out
├── lib.c
├── lib.h
├── lib.o
├── mcs
├── mcs.c
└── mcs.o


<br>
Compile the Code:<br>
Once you have confirmed the directory structure, simply type make in the terminal:
make

This command will compile the source files and should produce the following output:
gcc -c mcs.c
gcc -c lib.c
gcc mcs.o lib.o -o mcs


<br><br>After compiling the code, you can execute the program by entering the following command in the terminal:<br>./mcs &lt;InputFilename&gt;
<br>For example, to run the program with the input file named in, type:<br>./mcs in
<br>This command will run the program using the data specified in the in file. Make sure that the input file is in the correct format and location as expected by the program.]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/daa/assignment/daa-programming-assignment.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Algorithm/DAA/Assignment/DAA-Programming-Assignment.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[DAA-Assignment-2]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Export to clipboard<br>Note that his algorithm is exactly same as Kruskal’s algorithm except that the loop from line 7 to 12 iterates on edges in the decreasing order. (15pts)<br>I think his opinion is correct.<br><br>
<br>Heavy Edge: An edge is considered a heavy edge crossing a cut if its weight is the maximum among all edges crossing that cut.
<br>Safe Edge: An edge is considered safe if its inclusion in the growing forest does not violate the properties of the maximum spanning tree (i.e., it does not create a cycle with edges already included in the MST and its addition results in a spanning tree with the maximum possible total weight).
<br><br>Case I: Heavy Edge is Safe Edge<br>
<br>If the heavy edge is part of the MST, then by definition, it contributes to forming the maximum possible weight of the MST.
<br>Since it is the heaviest edge across a particular cut and it is part of the MST, it is safe because its exclusion would result in a non-optimal tree (i.e., a tree with less total weight).
<br>Case II: Heavy Edge is Not Safe Edge<br>
<br>Assume for contradiction that there is a heavy edge across a cut which is not included in the MST, implying it is not safe.
<br>If is the heaviest edge crossing the cut and is not included, then to maintain connectivity and maximize total weight, there must be another edge through the cut.
<br>However, was defined as the heaviest edge, so no edge can have a greater weight than.
<br>This leads to a contradiction because it would imply that the current MST is not truly the maximum spanning tree as excluding reduces the possible total weight.
<br><br>Given a weighted connect graph , a path from &nbsp;to &nbsp;is simple if no vertex on the path is repeated. A simple path is maximum if the length on the simple path is the largest. Such length is called maximum distance from  to  , denoted as .<br>Mr. Smart designs the following algorithm to find the maximum simple path from one vertices to all other vertices. Is his algorithm correct? Prove your answer.<br>

<br>Basic Concepts
<br>Binary Trees
<br>Binary Search Trees
<br><br>A tree is a collection of nodes<br>
<br>The collection can be empty
<br>(recursive definition) If not empty, a tree consists of a distinguished node r (the root), and zero or more nonempty subtrees , each of whose roots are connected by a directed edge from root
<br>Concept<br>
<br>Root and Leaf
<br>Child and Parent

<br>Every node except the root has one parent
<br>A node can have an zero or more children
<br>A leaf node has no children


<br>Sibling<br>
nodes with same parent
<br>Path<br>
<br>a sequence of edges
<br>Length of a path<br>
Depth of a node<br>
<br>length of the unique path to the root
<br>Height of a node<br>
<br>length of the longest path to a leaf
<br>Tree height<br>
<br>the height of the root
<br>the depth of the deepest leaf
<br>Ancestor and descendant<br>
<br>If there is a path from n1 to n2
<br>n1 is an ancestor of n2, n2 is a descendant of n1
<br>Proper ancestor and proper descendant
<br><br>A perfect binary tree is the tree where a node can have 0 or 2 children and all leaves are at the same depth<br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DSA/Tree/PerfectBinaryTree.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/binarytree.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Algorithm/DSA/BinaryTree.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DSA/Tree/PerfectBinaryTree.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DSA/Tree/PerfectBinaryTree.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[<span class="math math-inline is-loaded"><mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX"><mjx-msup><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D435 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" size="s"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2B"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-script></mjx-msup><mjx-mtext class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-cA0"></mjx-c></mjx-mtext><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D447 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D45F TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D452 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D452 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math></mjx-container></span>]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>
Binary search tree has one key to decide which of the two branches to take

<br>
M-ary search tree needs M-1 keys to decide which branch to take

<br>
M-ary search tree should be balanced in some way.

<br>We don’t want an M-ary search tree to degenerate to a linked list, or even a binary search tree


<br>
Thus, require that each node is at least half full!

<br><br>
<br>A B+ tree of order M
<br>Each internal node has at most M children (M-1 keys)
<br>Each internal node, except the root, has between  and  keys<br>
Each leaf has between  keys and corresponding data items
<br><br>
<br>
A  of order M (M&gt;3) is an M-ary tree with the following properties:

<br>
The data items are stored in leaves

<br>
The root is either a leaf or has between two and M children

<br>
The non-leaf nodes store up to M-1 keys to guide the searching; key i represents the smallest key in subtree i+1

<br>
All non-leaf nodes (except the root) have between  and M children

<br>
All leaves are at the same depth and have between  and L data items, for some L (usually L &lt;&lt; M, but we will assume M=L in most examples)

<br>
Keys in internal Nodes

<br>
key i in an internal node is the smallest key in its i+1 subtree (i.e. right subtree of key i)

<br><br><br>
<br>Suppose that we want to insert a key K and its associated record.
<br>Search for the key K using the search procedure. This will bring us to a leaf x
<br>Insert K into x
<br>Insert Into Leaf<br>
<br>If leaf x contains &lt; L keys, then insert K into x (at the correct position in node x)
<br>If x is already full (i.e. containing L keys) then split x

<br>Cut x off from its parent
<br>Insert K into x, pretending x has space for K. Now x has L+1 keys.
<br>After inserting K, split x into 2 new leaves  and , with  containing the  smallest keys, and  containing the remaining   keys.  Let J be the minimum key in 
<br>Make a copy of J to be the parent of  and , and insert the copy together with its child pointers into the old parent of x.


<br>Insert Into Internal Node When leaf is Full and Internal Node is also Full<br>To insert a key K into a full internal node x:<br>
<br>Cut x off from its parent
<br>Insert K and its left and right child pointers into x, pretending there is space.  Now x has M keys (and M+1 pointers).
<br>Split x into 2 new internal nodes  and , with  containing the   smallest keys, and  containing the  largest keys.  Note that the  key J is not placed in  or <br>
Make J the parent of xL and xR, and insert J together with its child pointers into the old parent of x.
<br><br>Situation I:<br>
<br>The target is a key in some internal node (needs to be replaced, according to our convention)
<br>Situation II:<br>
<br>After deleting target from leaf x, x contains less than  keys (needs to merge nodes)
<br><br>After deleting from node x, we can access y directly and replace target by the new smallest key in x<br><br>Let u be the leaf that has  keys (too few)<br>
Let v be a sibling of u with at least  keys<br>
Let k be the key in the parent of u and v that separates the pointers to u and v<br>
There are two cases<br><br>Case 1: v contains  or more keys and v is the right sibling of u<br>
Move the leftmost record from v to u<br><br>v contains  or more keys and v is the left sibling of u<br>
Move the rightmost record from v to u<br>
Then set the key in parent of u that separates u and v to be the new smallest key in u]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/algorithm/dsa/b+tree.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Algorithm/DSA/B+Tree.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AVL]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>阶（Order）：图G中点集V的大小称作图G的阶

<br>子图（Sub-Graph）：当图，其中 ，则称作图的子图


<br>生成子图（Spanning Sub-Graph）：指满足条件V(G′) = V(G)的G的子图
<br>度（Degree）：一个顶点的度是指与该顶点相关联的边的条数，顶点v的度记作d(v)。
<br>入度（In-degree）和出度（Out-degree）：一个顶点的入度是指与其关联的各边之中，以其为终点的边数；出度则是相对的概念，指以该顶点为起点的边数。
<br>自环（Loop）：若一条边的两个顶点为同一顶点，则此边称作自环。
<br>路径（Path）：从a到b的一条路径是指一个序列a(v0),e_1,v_1,e_2,v_2,…,e(k-1),b(vk) ，其中e_i的顶点为v_i及v(i-1)，k称作路径的长度。如果它的起止顶点相同，该路径是“闭”的，反之，则称为“开”的。
<br>行迹（Trace）：如果路径P(a,b)中的边各不相同，则该路径称为a到b的一条行迹。闭的行迹称作回路（Circuit）。
<br>轨道（Track）：如果路径P(u,v)中的顶点各不相同，则该路径称为a到b的一条轨道。闭的轨道称作圈（Cycle）。
<br>桥（Bridge）：若去掉一条边，便会使得整个图不连通，该边称为桥。

 <br><br><br>程序调用自身的编程技巧称为递归 Recursion<br>
<br>递归作为一种算法在程序设计语言中广泛应用。
<br>一个过程或函数在其定义或说明中有直接或间接调用自身的一种方法，它通常把一个大型复杂的问题层层转化为一个与原问题相似的规模较小的问题来求解。
<br>递归策略只需少量的程序就可描述出解题过程所需要的多次重复计算，大大地减少了程序的代码量。 
<br>一般来说，递归需要有边界条件、递归前进段和递归返回段。
<br>当边界条件不满足时，递归前进；当边界条件满足时，递归返回。
<br>递归的能力在于用有限的语句来定义对象的无限集合。<br><br>递归：你打开面前这扇门，看到屋里面还有一扇门。你走过去，发现手中的钥匙还可以打开它，你推开门，发现里面还有一扇门，你继续打开它。若干次之后，你打开面前的门后，发现只有一间屋子，没有门了。然后，你开始原路返回，每走回一间屋子，你数一次，走到入口的时候，你可以回答出你到底用这你把钥匙打开了几扇门。<br>循环：你打开面前这扇门，看到屋里面还有一扇门。你走过去，发现手中的钥匙还可以打开它，你推开门，发现里面还有一扇门（若前面两扇门都一样，那么这扇门和前两扇门也一样；如果第二扇门比第一扇门小，那么这扇门也比第二扇门小，你继续打开这扇门，一直这样继续下去直到打开所有的门。但是，入口处的人始终等不到你回去告诉他答案。<br><br>1. 明确递归终止条件（递归出口）<br>我们知道，递归就是有去有回，既然这样，那么必然应该有一个明确的临界点，程序一旦到达了这个临界点，就不用继续往下递去而是开始实实在在的归来。换句话说，该临界点就是一种简单情境，可以防止无限递归。<br>2. 给出递归终止时的处理办法<br>我们刚刚说到，在递归的临界点存在一种简单情境，在这种简单情境下，我们应该直接给出问题的解决方案。一般地，在这种情境下，问题的解决方案是直观的、容易的。<br>3. 提取重复的逻辑，缩小问题规模<br>我们在阐述递归思想内涵时谈到，递归问题必须可以分解为若干个规模较小、与原问题形式相同的子问题，这些子问题可以用相同的解题思路来解决。从程序实现的角度而言，我们需要抽象出一个干净利落的重复的逻辑，以便使用相同的方式解决子问题。<br><br><br><br>柳州传说是歌仙刘三姐的传歌之地，最近举办了一次山歌大赛。 在这个项目中，参赛者每次完成一个段都会得到一个分数。总分数的计算方式基于一个特殊 的数学表达式 f(x,n)。表达式 f(x,n) 的定义如下：<br><img title="4e4fe6b7f35886e021f9a1fa1334df4.jpg" alt="4e4fe6b7f35886e021f9a1fa1334df4.jpg" src="https://img.lsyz.top/2022/08/09/25ad9e9d95723.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>其中，x 表示参赛者的基本得分，n 表示参赛者完成的山歌段落数。<br>津津、菲菲和皮皮的任务是编写一个程序，并计算选手 A（x=4.2,n=10）、选手 B（x=2.5,n=15） 时 f(x,n)的值<br><br>输入x和n。<br><br>函数值，保留两位小数。<br><br>Input<br>4.2 10

 <br><br><br>最长回文子串
给定一个字符串&nbsp;s，找到&nbsp;s&nbsp;中最长的回文子串。
示例 1：
输入：s = "babad"<br>
输出："bab"<br>
解释："aba" 同样是符合题意的答案。
示例 2：
输入：s = "cbbd"<br>
输出："bb"
提示：

<br>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 1000
<br>s&nbsp;仅由数字和英文字母组成

<br><br>
<br>对每个字符都向两侧扩展，判断是否为回文串

<br><br><br>回文子串
返回字符串s的回文子串数量
<br><br>不重叠回文子字符串的最大数目
给定一个字符串str和一个正数k<br>
你可以随意把str切分成多个子串<br>
目的是找到某一种划分方案，有尽可能多的回文子串<br>
并且每个回文子串都要求长度&gt;=k、且彼此没有重合的部分<br>
返回最多能划分出几个这样的回文子串
<br><br>拉拉队排练
长度前k名的奇数长度回文子串长度乘积<br>
给定一个字符串s和数值k，只关心所有奇数长度的回文子串<br>
返回其中长度前k名的回文子串的长度乘积是多少<br>
如果奇数长度的回文子串个数不够k个，返回-1
<br><br>最长双回文串
最长双回文串长度<br>
输入字符串s，求s的最长双回文子串t的长度<br>
双回文子串就是可以分成两个回文串的字符串<br>
比如"aabb"，可以分成"aa"、"bb"

<br>Metabolic Processes: Many of the significant GO terms, such as “small molecule catabolic process,” “steroid metabolic process,” and “amino acid metabolic process,” suggest that metabolic reprogramming may play a crucial role in differentiating tumor cells from normal cells. This is consistent with the well-known phenomenon of altered metabolism in cancer cells, often referred to as the “Warburg effect.”
<br>Catabolic Processes: Processes like “organic acid catabolic process” and “alpha-amino acid catabolic process” are enriched, indicating that these pathways might be more active in tumor cells, possibly to meet the high energy and biosynthetic demands of rapidly proliferating cells.

<br>Describe the seven levels of transformations of a computer system.
<br>
<br>The seven levels of transformations in a computer system represent the progression from identifying a problem to the physical realization in a device. It starts with understanding the problem and formulating an algorithm, then translating it into a program. The program is mapped to an instruction set architecture, which is further implemented in a microarchitecture. At a lower level, the microarchitecture is translated into circuits, and finally, these circuits are realized in physical devices.

<br><br>Answer:<br>
<br>
Interrupts: Using interrupts for handling I/O provides the advantage of allowing the processor to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete. When an I/O device has finished its operation, it triggers an interrupt, allowing the CPU to immediately handle the data transfer or task associated with the I/O device. This approach is more efficient as it doesn't waste CPU cycles continuously checking the status of the I/O device.

<br>
Polling: Polling involves the CPU constantly checking the status of an I/O device to determine if it needs attention or has completed its task. It's simpler to implement but can be less efficient than using interrupts because it ties up the CPU in a loop, consuming processing power even when the I/O device doesn't need immediate attention. Polling might be used in scenarios where the hardware doesn't support interrupts or when the overhead of handling interrupts is too high compared to the frequency of I/O operations.

<br><br>Answer:<br>The last instruction in the interrupt service program is usually "RTI" (opcode 1000). It returns from the Interrupt Pops PSR and PC of the Supervisor stack, recovering the conditional code from the PSR. If necessary (i.e., if the current permission mode is User), revert from Saved.USP to a user stack pointer to R6.]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/computer-organization/assignment/assignment-4/co-assignment-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Computer Organization/Assignment/Assignment-4/CO-Assignment-4.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lab8]]></title><description><![CDATA[

For inputs SR = 00, the next value of Q could be either or 1, depending on the current value of Q.

<br>
So the same inputs can yield different outputs, depending on whether the latch was previously set or reset.

<br>
This is very different from the combinational circuits that we’ve seen so far, where the same inputs always yield the same outputs.

<br>There is a finite time delay between a change in the inputs of a gate and any change in the output. This time is called gate delay.(栅极延迟)
<br>In order to avoid glitches, we want to design storage elements that only accept input when ordered to so We use a clock to be the control input that gives orders to the circuit about when to change states
<br><br>A clock is a special circuit that produces electrical pulses<br>
Clock speed is generally measured in megahertz (Mhz), or millions of pulses per second<br>
A clock is used by a sequential circuit to decide when to update the state of the circuit 决定何时更新电路状态<br>
inputs to the circuit can only affect the storage element at given, discrete instances of time<br><img alt="CJX7UK" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/CJX7UK.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>Edge-triggered: allowed to change their states on either the rising or falling edge of the clock signal
<br>Level-triggered: allowed to change state whenever the clock signal is either high or low
<br>Technically, a latch is level triggered, whereas a flip-flop is edge triggered<br>
锁存器是电平触发，触发器是边缘触发
<br><br>
<br>When C is 1, the circuit acts just like the NOR gate S-R latch.
<br>When C is 0, the Set and Reset inputs are disabled
<br>The latch can change only when C is true<br>

10根地址线的微处理器（1KB内存）：

<br>这个微处理器有10根地址线，这意味着它可以寻址 (2^{10}) 个不同的内存位置，可访问1KB（1千字节）的内存。


<br>
存储芯片：

<br>为了覆盖整个内存空间，选择了128 x 8存储芯片。每个芯片的容量为128个存储位置（128个地址），每个存储位置可存储8位（1字节）。


<br>
所需存储芯片数量：

<br>由于总内存空间为1KB，每个芯片的容量为128个存储位置，因此需要总共8个芯片（(1 \text{KB} / 128 \text{每芯片的位置})）来容纳整个内存空间（(8 \text{芯片} \times 128 = 1024 \text{位置})）。


<br>
芯片选择：

<br>为了选择8个存储芯片中的每一个，使用3根地址线。使用3根地址线可以选择8个芯片中的任意一个（因为 (2^3 = 8)）。


<br>
每个芯片内存位置的选择：

<br>在每个芯片内部，需要7根地址线来寻址内部存储单元。这7根线帮助选择每个芯片中128个存储位置中的特定一个。


<br>
地址：000 0000000：

<br>这是一个示例地址。前三位数（000）用于选择8个存储芯片中的一个。剩下的7位数（0000000）用于在选定的芯片内选择特定的存储位置，其中每个芯片有128个可用的存储位置。

A Danger Sign

<br>
当开关断开<br>
If the switch is turned off, all the lights are turned off and remain off

<br>
当开关闭合<br>
When the switch is in the ON position, the controller directs the lights as follows: During one unit of time, all lights will be off. In the next unit of time, lights 1 and 2 will be on. The next unit of time, lights 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be on. Then all five lights will be on. Then the sequence repeats: no lights on, followed by 1 and 2 on, followed by 1, 2, 3, and 4 on, and so forth.<br>

<br>First, the two external inputs: the switch and the clock. The switch determines whether the finite state machine will transition through the four states or whether it will transition to state A, where all lights are off. The other input (the clock) controls the transition from state A to B, B to C, C to D, and D to A by controlling the state of the storage elements. We will see how, momentarily.
<br>Second, there are two storage elements for storing state information. Since there are four states, and since each storage element can store one bit of information, the four states are identified by the contents of the two storage elements: A (00), B (01), C (10), and D (11). Storage element 2 contains the high bit; storage element 1 contains the low bit. For example, the danger sign controller is in state B when storage element 2 is 0 and storage element 1 is 1.
<br>Third, combinational logic circuit 1 shows that the on/off behavior of the lights is controlled by the storage elements. That is, the input to the combinational logic circuit is from the two storage elements, that is, the current state of the finite state machine.
<br>Finally, combinational logic circuit 2 shows that the transition from the current state to the next state depends on the two storage elements and the switch. If the switch is on, the output of combinational logic circuit 2 depends on the state of the two storage elements.
<br><br>
<br>A Turing machine is a finite state machine plus a tape memory.
<br>Each transition may be accompanied by an operation on the tape (move, read, write).
<br>Its total possible configurations are arbitrarily large, regardless of the size of the program; it expands towards infinity.
<br>Turing machines have more computational power than FSM.

Definition:

<br>electronic, digital, general purpose computing machine that automatically follows a step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem.
<br>This step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows is also called a computer program.


<br>
Computer Part:  case, motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply, hard drive, graphic cards.

<br><br>
<br>
In 1936, British mathematician Alan Turing developed a hypothetical device, the Turing machine, which is the abstract model of all computers

<br>
A Turing machine consists of

<br>a tape divided into cells
<br>a moving read/write head
<br>a state register storing the state of the Turing machine
<br>a finite table of instruction specifying what the machine does when reading the content of the current cell:

<br>move right/left; erase/write a symbol; change the state




<br>
All things that can be computed can be computed by a Turing machine

<br><br>
<br>Turing described a Turing machine that could simulate all other Turing machines.

<br>inputs: data + a description of computation (Turing machine)


<br>A computer is a Universal Turing Machine!

 <br><br>Assembler is a program that turns symbols into binary machine instructions.<br><br>
<br>Each line of a program is one of the following:

<br>an instruction
<br>an assembler directive (or pseudo-op)
<br>a comment


<br>Whitespace (between symbols) and case are ignored.
<br>Comments (beginning with “;”) are also ign
<br><br>LABEL OPCODE OPERANDS COMMENTS<br>
<br>optional: Label, Comments
<br>mandatory: Opcode, Operands
<br><br>
<br>Opcodes:

<br>reserved symbols that correspond to LC-3 instructions
<br>example: ADD, AND, LD, LDR


<br>Operands：

<br>Registers:
<br>Numbers: #(DEC) or x(HEX)
<br>Label: symbolic name oof memory location


<br><br>placed  at the beginning of the line<br>
assigns a symbolic name to the address corresponding to line<br>Loop ADD R1,R1,#-1
     Brp LOOP
<br><br>
<br>Anything after a semincolon is comments
<br>Ignored by assembler
<br>Used by humans to document/ understand programs
<br>Tips for useful comments:

<br>avoid restating the obvious, as “decrement R1”
<br>provide additional insight, as in “accumulate product in R6”
<br>use comments to separate pieces of program


<br><br>Pseudo-operations<br>
<br>Do not refer to operations executed by program
<br>used by assembler
<br>look like instruction, but "opcode" starts whith dots

Decoder（译为解码器）是数字电路中的一个常见组件，它用于将输入的编码信号转换成特定的输出信号，根据输入信号的不同编码，Decoder产生不同的输出信号。Decoder有多种用途，包括：<br>
<br>
控制逻辑：Decoder用于生成控制信号，这些信号用于控制其他数字电路的操作。例如，它可以用于选择特定的操作模式，启用或禁用特定功能等。

<br>
地址解码：在微处理器和微控制器中，Decoder用于解码指令地址，以确定下一步执行的指令或操作。

<br>Decoder是数字电路中的一种重要元件，用于将输入信号从一种编码形式转换为另一种有意义的输出信号，从而实现数据选择、控制、解码和路由等功能。<br><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/CO/A2-4Decoder.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/noYq2M.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>2-4 Decoder（也称为2输入4输出解码器）是一种特定类型的解码器，它具有两个输入线和四个输出线。它的主要功能是将两个输入线的组合编码映射到四个输出线，其中每个输入组合对应一个输出线。<br>一般情况下，2-4 Decoder的真值表如下：<br><br><br>
<br>A multiplexer behaves like a channel selector
<br>It selects a single output from several inputs.
<br>The particular input chosen for output is determined by the value of the multiplexer's control lines.
<br>To be able to select among n inputs, log2 n control lines are needed
<br>多个输入一个输出  由控制线路选择选择输出线路
<br><br>4-to-1 Multiplexer（四选一多路器）是数字电路中的一个常见组件，用于从多个输入信号中选择一个输出信号。它有四个数据输入（通常称为I0、I1、I2和I3），两个控制输入（通常称为S0和S1），一个电源开关（E），一个输出（通常称为Y）。<br>4-to-1 Multiplexer的运行原理如下：<br>
<br>
控制输入：S1和S0是控制输入，它们确定要从哪一个数据输入传递到输出。这两个控制线有四种可能的组合：00、01、10和11，分别对应着选择I0、I1、I2和I3作为输出。

<br>
数据输入：有四个数据输入（I0、I1、I2和I3），每个数据输入上都可以连接一个不同的输入信号。

<br>
输出：根据S1和S0的状态，Multiplexer会选择一个数据输入作为输出。例如，如果S1=0且S0=1，那么Multiplexer会将D1的值传递到输出Y。

<br>
How many more colors human can distinguish compared with shrimp? Why?

<br>Humans can distinguish around 10 million colors, while mantis shrimp detect more spectral bands with their 16 photoreceptor types.
<br>Humans may be better at distinguishing colors because their brains have more processing power.


<br>
What light spectrum range human can see?

<br>Humans can see light in the range of 400nm to 700nm


<br>
What is hyperspectral imaging? And its applications？

<br>Hyperspectral imaging captures images of many spectral bands beyond visible light.
<br>It is used in astronomy, precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.


<br>
What’s the history of animal vision? History of computer vision?

<br>Animal vision evolved from simple eye points to complex eyes with rods and cones to detect color and light.
<br>Computer vision began as basic image recognition in the 1960s and evolved with the development of deep learning in the early 2000s, and is now used in areas such as self-driving cars and medical imaging.

<br>信号可能会爆炸或消失：在深度神经网络中，前向传播和反向传播的信号经过多层网络时，如果初始化不当，信号的方差可能会逐渐变大（梯度爆炸）或逐渐减小到接近零（梯度消失）。这种现象会导致网络训练困难：

<br>梯度消失：早期层几乎没有梯度更新，导致模型难以学习到深层特征。
<br>梯度爆炸：梯度过大，导致训练不稳定，甚至网络无法收敛。


<br>因此，适当的权重初始化可以在一定程度上缓解梯度消失或爆炸的问题。<br><br>
<br>缩放因子的乘积：在多层网络中，信号的方差会受到每一层的缩放因子的影响，这些缩放因子包括权重的方差和输入连接的数量。多层网络中每一层的方差会累积（即每一层的缩放因子相乘），最终导致信号变得过大或过小。因此，初始化中的缩放因子（即权重的方差）需要精心设置，以确保信号的稳定传递。
<br><br>
<br>初始化依赖于归一化：初始化的设计通常依赖于信号在不同层之间的方差归一化（Normalization）。例如，Xavier 和 Kaiming 初始化方法都根据层输入或输出的数量来选择合适的方差，从而在前向和反向传播中保持信号的方差平衡。归一化使得信号在层与层之间不会失去平衡，从而避免梯度消失或爆炸。
<br><br>
<br>初始化基于强假设：权重初始化通常假设输入和输出分布具有一定的独立性和零均值。例如，Xavier 和 Kaiming 初始化假设每个输入和输出的分布是独立同分布（iid），并且权重的期望值为零。这些假设有助于推导出初始化方差的公式，但在实际应用中，这些假设可能不完全成立。因此，初始化并不能完全解决深度网络的训练难题。
<br><br>
<br>初始化是必要的，但往往不够：虽然合适的权重初始化对稳定训练非常重要，但在深度网络中，仅仅靠初始化往往是不够的。为了进一步改善训练，通常还需要其他技术的配合，比如：

<br>Batch Normalization：在每一层对信号进行归一化，进一步防止梯度消失或爆炸。
<br>残差连接（Residual Connections）：允许信号绕过若干层，减少梯度消失问题。
<br>更高级的优化算法（例如 Adam、RMSProp）：帮助更快地收敛，并且在初始化不完美的情况下提供一定的鲁棒性。

<br>学习率：学习率控制步长。步长过大可能会错过最优解，步长过小则训练速度较慢。
<br><br>反向传播和权重更新的过程会对每一层重复进行，直到所有层的权重都更新完毕。这一轮的梯度计算和更新完成后，模型的权重就得到了调整。然后，我们继续下一轮训练（即下一批数据），重复上述的前向传播、反向传播和更新步骤。<br><br>假设你要更新某个中间层 的梯度：<br>

p.imshow(I ,cmap='gray', vmin=0.0,vmax=1.0);
p.show();
<br>Tip

<br>rand(256,256) 生成一个 256x256 的随机矩阵, 值在 0-1 之间
<br>cmap = 'gray' 表示使用灰度图显示	
<br>vmin 和 vmax 分别表示最小值和最大值 
<br>matplotlib.pyplot.imshow() 函数用于显示图像, 一般可以自动数值normalize到 0-1 之间
<br>vmin 和 vmax 可以指定normalize的范围

<br><br>8 bit image: 256 gray levels	<br>
<br>e.g. 256x256 = 65,536 pixels
<br>256 values ^ 65,536 pixels = 256^65,536	
<br><br>
<br>Signal: function depending on some variable with physical meaning.
<br>Image: sampling of that function.

<br>2 variables: xy coordinates
<br>3 variables: xy + time (video)
<br>‘Brightness’ is the value of the function for visible light


<br>Can be other physical values too: temperature, pressure, depth …

<br>信号不仅限于亮度，还可以表示其他物理量。例如，红外图像可以表示温度，海洋探测图像可以表示深度，气象图像可以表示压力等。

<br>Sampling in 1D takes a function and returns a vector whose elements are values of that function at the sample points.

<br>Sampling in 2D takes a function and returns a matrix.

<br>Digital values – integer values

<br>Quantization is lossy!! After quantization, the original signal cannot be reconstructed anymore
<br>In contrast to sampling, as a sampled but not quantized signal can be reconstructed.


<br>Simple quantization uses equally spaced levels with k intervals<br>
量化是一种将连续信号转换为离散值的过程。在简单量化中，整个信号的范围会被均匀地划分为 k 个区间（或称为级别）。这些区间之间的间隔是相同的，因此称为“等间隔”。每个信号的值都会被映射到其对应的区间，最终得到的是有限的离散值，而不是连续的信号。

<br>Convolution is the same as correlation with a 180° rotated filter kernel.
<br>Correlation and convolution are identical when the filter kernel is symmetric.
<br><br>
<br>卷积可以看作是相关的一种变体，唯一的区别是卷积中的滤波器会先进行180度的旋转。
<br>当滤波器是对称的时，卷积和相关是相同的。这是因为旋转180度不会改变滤波器的形状。
<br><br><br><br>线性滤波器的线性性意味着，对于输入图像  I  以及两个滤波器  f_1  和  f_2 ，对图像应用滤波器的结果等于先将滤波器相加，再应用一次滤波，或者分别应用每个滤波器，再将结果相加。<br>
换句话说，滤波操作对滤波器的加法是可交换的，可以直接作用于滤波器的线性组合。<br><br><br>平移不变性指的是滤波器的输出与像素位置无关，意思是无论图像中的像素在什么位置，滤波器对强度的操作结果都是相同的。也就是说，滤波器的应用不会因为图像的某个区域平移而改变输出。<br>
在公式中，如果我们先将滤波器  f  平移，再对图像  I  进行滤波，这与先对图像  I  进行滤波，然后再平移滤波结果是等价的。<br>Any linear, shift-invariant operator can be represented as a convolution.<br><br><br><br>
<br>Conceptually no difference between filter and signal
<br>But particular filtering implementations might break this equality
<br><br><br>
<br>Often apply several filters one after another: 
<br>This is equivalent to applying one filter:

<br>假设最小的数只有一个，那么最后只剩它自己
<br>如果最小的数不止一个

Alongside cryptologist Sophie Neveu, Langdon unravels a complex web of codes, symbols, and historical secrets tied to a hidden truth about the Holy Grail and the controversial legacy of Mary Magdalene. The story presents a fictional European secret society, the Priory of Sion, supposedly founded in 1099 and involving famous figures such as Leonardo da Vinci. Another Catholic organization, Opus Dei, emerges in the narrative as a shadowy force, sparking further intrigue. 

The plot unfolds through a series of cryptic messages and objects, including a keystone believed to lead to the Grail’s hidden location. Langdon and Sophie encounter numerous obstacles, including Silas, a devout albino monk, and Leigh Teabing, a Grail historian with his own hidden motives. As they decode symbols like the pentacle and the number PHI, they chase leads through significant historical sites like Westminster Abbey and Rosslyn Chapel. The story weaves themes of faith, power, and historical mystery, ultimately suggesting a hidden lineage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene that could challenge traditional Christian beliefs.

 <br><br><br>Goal: Automatically construct a social network of main characters from the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.<br>This project seeks to build an automated process for extracting and visualizing the relationships between characters from a novel. By identifying these relationships, I aim to construct a knowledge graph that can reveal social dynamics within the story and highlight the influence of key characters. Additionally, by applying association mining and ranking algorithms, I can identify central figures and their interactions, uncovering character importance based on the narrative context.<br><br>Character networks are a powerful tool for understanding story structure and character interactions within a narrative. By constructing a network from a text, I can better understand the influence and relationships of main characters, as well as visualize social dynamics within a story. In this project, I use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) methods to achieve this automatically, focusing on entity extraction, relationship detection, and visualization.<br><br>In the previous lab, I used a pretrained BERT model to generate a summary of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, focusing on condensing the storyline to capture essential events and character dynamics. However, I found that understanding relationships within the text requires more than a summary; the text is rich in complex and often implicit relationships between characters. Directly identifying these relationships through rule-based methods or simple keyword matching is challenging due to the intricate, ambiguous, and context-dependent language used in the narrative.<br>To address these complexities, I chose to use the BERT model again in this lab, this time to identify character relationships. BERT’s ability to grasp nuanced meanings allows us to extract a clearer representation of character interactions. With pretrained language models, I can leverage their deep contextual understanding, bypassing some of the limitations of traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques.<br>The aim in this lab is to expand beyond summarization to focus specifically on identifying relationships between characters and building a structured knowledge graph. This graph provides a visual and analytical tool for representing the social network within the story, enhancing our ability to analyze and understand the relational patterns and central characters of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.<br><br>The social network of characters is represented in two main components:<br>
<br>Nodes: Represent the characters in the book.
<br>Edges: Represent the relationships between these characters.
<br>Our approach is organized into three main steps: Entity Extraction, Relationship Extraction, and Knowledge Graph Construction.<br><br>
<br>We use spaCy to extract named entities, focusing specifically on character names (e.g., Harry Potter, Hermione Granger).
<br>This involves Named Entity Recognition (NER) to filter and retain only entities labeled as persons.
<br> <img alt="Main Character" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/uT1f9K.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>def extract_entities(text):
    words = word_tokenize(text)

    for subtree in chunked:
        if isinstance(subtree, Tree) and subtree.label() == "PERSON":
            entity = " ".join([leaf[0] for leaf in subtree.leaves()])
            entities.append(entity)
    return entities
<br><br>We employ two approaches to extract relationships between entities: spaCy Dependency Parsing and Pretrained BERT Model.<br><br>By parsing sentences with spaCy, I identify syntactic dependencies (e.g., subject-verb-object structures) to detect relationships between entities. This allows us to infer direct relationships based on grammatical structure.<br>def get_entity_relationships(text):
    words = word_tokenize(text)
    pos_tags = pos_tag(words)
    entities = extract_entities(text)
    relationships = []
    for i in range(len(entities) - 1):
        entity1 = entities[i]
        entity2 = entities[i + 1]
        relation = None
        start = words.index(entity1.split()[0]) + len(entity1.split())
        end = words.index(entity2.split()[0])
        for j in range(start, end):
            if pos_tags[j][1].startswith("VB"):  # find Vb
                relation = pos_tags[j][0]
                break
        if relation:
            relationships.append((entity1, relation, entity2))
    #remove duplicate
    relationships = list(set(relationships))
    return relationships
<br><br>Using a BERT-based NER model helps capture nuanced relationships that may not be directly linked through syntax alone, allowing for richer contextual understanding of connections between characters.<br><br>
<br>We utilize Neo4j to build and visualize the knowledge graph. Here, characters are represented as nodes, and relationships between them as edges.

<br>Each edge captures the interaction type (e.g., “friends with,” “enemy of”) based on verbs or action words derived from the text.


<br>def create_relationships(df, graph):
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        character_a = Node("Character", label="Character", text=row["Character"])
        character_b = Node("Character", label="Character", text=row["Target Character"])
        graph.merge(character_a, "Character", "text")
        graph.merge(character_b, "Character", "text")
        relationship = Relationship(character_a, row["Relationship Type"], character_b, notes=row["Notes"])
        graph.create(relationship)
<br><br><img alt="Knowledge Graph" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/3chsG1.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>With the Neo4j database, I visualize and explore the relationships in the character network. This allows us to:<br>
<br>Identify Key Characters: Use centrality measures to find pivotal figures in the network.
<br>Analyze Relationship Dynamics: Track patterns such as alliances or rivalries by filtering specific relationship types.
<br><br>Objective: Identify and rank the main characters based on their significance and centrality in the character network.<br>PageRank is a powerful tool that I use in this context to rank the characters according to their significance in the story. Here’s a breakdown of how PageRank works and how it helps us analyze the network of characters:<br>
<br>
Using PageRank to Find Main Characters:

<br>PageRank Basics: Originally designed to rank web pages by their importance, the PageRank algorithm considers both the quantity and quality of connections to each node (character, in our case) in a graph. A character with many connections, or connections to other well-connected characters, will have a high PageRank score.
<br>Application to Social Network: By applying PageRank to our knowledge graph of characters, I assign scores that represent each character’s relative importance within the story. Characters with high PageRank scores tend to be those who interact most frequently or with other prominent characters, highlighting them as central figures.
<br>Main Character Identification: Characters with the highest PageRank scores are likely central to the story, as they either have many direct interactions or connect with other important characters.

<img alt="PageRank Scores of Characters" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/PageRank%20Scores%20of%20Characters.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

<br>
Analysis of Results:

<br>Insight into Social Structure: PageRank doesn’t just count relationships; it evaluates their importance, meaning a character with fewer but stronger or more meaningful relationships may rank higher than a character with many minor connections. This helps in identifying not just the protagonists but other influential characters who play key roles in the story’s dynamics.
<br>Uncovering Hidden Dynamics: Some characters may appear more central than expected. For example, a minor character with strategic connections to main characters can gain a surprisingly high PageRank score, revealing hidden dynamics or potentially under appreciated roles.
<br>Visualizing Social Hierarchy: PageRank results provide a clearer picture of the social hierarchy, shedding light on character prominence beyond simple relationship counts and offering a more nuanced understanding of influence and connectivity.


<br>By leveraging PageRank, I achieve a deeper, data-driven understanding of the story’s social network, which complements traditional analysis methods and highlights characters based on their relational significance within the entire network structure. This method is particularly valuable for complex narratives where influence and centrality may not be immediately obvious.<br><br><img alt="Extract Entity and Relationship" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/1sdy1I.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>
Entity and Relationship Extraction:

<br>To identify characters and their relationships, I used spaCy’s dependency parsing as an initial approach. Dependency parsing provided a way to identify syntactic relations between characters, such as “subject-verb-object” structures, enabling us to detect straightforward relationships.
<br>Challenges with spaCy: Although fast, spaCy's dependency parsing often missed indirect relationships (e.g., relationships implied through context rather than direct grammatical structure) and subtle associations not explicitly stated in the text.
<br>To address this, I incorporated a pretrained BERT model for relationship extraction. BERT’s deep understanding of contextual language nuances allowed us to capture both direct and implied relationships by learning from large datasets. This model enhanced our extraction accuracy, especially for complex interactions like alliances, rivalries, and hierarchical relationships within the narrative.


<br>
Comparison of Methods:

<br>spaCy:

<br>Advantages: Fast and efficient for identifying direct, grammatical relationships, making it suitable for quick scans of straightforward sentence structures.
<br>Limitations: Less effective for nuanced or context-dependent relationships, as it primarily relies on syntactic dependencies rather than context.


<br>BERT Model:

<br>Advantages: Strong at capturing complex and implied relationships due to its pretrained nature on a large corpus. It understands context deeply, which allowed us to detect less explicit relationships between characters.
<br>Limitations: Higher computational requirements, with slower processing times due to the model’s complexity.


<br>Outcome: By combining both methods, I achieved a balance, leveraging spaCy for speed and BERT for nuanced relationship extraction, improving the overall accuracy of our relationship data.


<br>
Graph Construction:

<br>Neo4j Knowledge Graph: Once entities and relationships were extracted, I built the knowledge graph in Neo4j, where nodes represented characters and edges captured the relationships between them.
<br>Iterative Graph Population: We incrementally added nodes and relationships based on extracted data. This allowed us to iteratively refine and enrich the graph as more relationships were identified.
<br>PageRank Computation: To quantify character importance, I used Neo4j’s built-in PageRank algorithm. PageRank is particularly useful in graph-based social networks as it calculates a character’s significance based on the number and quality of their connections. This helped us identify central figures in the story, revealing key characters whose actions influence many others.


<br><br>In our work, I explored three primary approaches for extracting and analyzing character relationships:<br>
<br>
Direct Text Extraction:

<br>We first tried simple rule-based methods and keyword matching to directly extract relationships from the text. This involved identifying explicit relationship indicators such as verbs or phrases that linked character pairs.
<br>Strengths: Quick and effective for simple, unambiguous relationships.
<br>Limitations: Missed implicit relationships (e.g., relationships inferred through tone or context) and often led to incomplete data due to its rigid nature. Relationships that were context-dependent or complex (e.g., alliances or rivalries that unfold over multiple sentences) were not fully captured.


<br>
Dependency Parsing and Language Models:

<br>Dependency Parsing: We used spaCy’s dependency parsing to analyze sentence structure and find relationships based on syntactic dependencies. This approach works well for direct interactions, as it maps grammatical roles within a sentence, such as subject and object, to identify relationship pathways.
<br>Pretrained Language Models: Using a BERT model, I extracted relationships with greater context sensitivity, capturing implied associations and indirect relationships that are often challenging to detect via dependency parsing alone.
<br>Strengths: Dependency parsing provides structural clarity for simple relationships, while BERT’s contextual understanding brings out subtler interactions.
<br>Limitations: Dependency parsing lacks adaptability for context-rich relationships, while BERT, though powerful, requires more computational resources and may need fine-tuning for specific literature-based tasks.


<br>
Graph-Based Analysis:

<br>Knowledge Graph Construction: By representing characters and relationships as nodes and edges, respectively, in Neo4j, I could explore relationships visually and structurally.
<br>Graph Algorithms: Beyond visualizing relationships, I applied algorithms like PageRank to compute the influence or importance of each character within the network. This provided quantitative insights into character significance, identifying central figures who hold key roles in the story's social fabric.
<br>Strengths: Graph-based analysis, particularly using algorithms like PageRank, allows for an exploration of social structure and character influence, helping us understand the dynamics of the character network.
<br>Limitations: This approach requires well-extracted relationships to produce meaningful insights, so its effectiveness is tied to the quality of initial data extraction.


<br><br>The dataset consists of the full text of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Key considerations in preparing the data included:<br>
<br>Preprocessing: Text was cleaned and segmented to allow for more accurate entity and relationship extraction.
<br>Annotation: Entities (characters) were annotated and verified to ensure consistency in the knowledge graph.
<br>Relationship Validation: Relationships extracted by the model were manually reviewed to ensure accuracy in the final network.
<br><br>In this lab, I explored an automated approach to constructing a social network of characters from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by combining advanced entity and relationship extraction techniques with graph-based analysis.<br>Our process demonstrated the value of using pretrained language models, such as BERT, to capture nuanced relationships within text that traditional rule-based methods may overlook. While spaCy’s dependency parsing provided an efficient initial method for extracting explicit syntactic relationships, the addition of BERT allowed us to recognize more complex associations, enriching the extracted data.<br>Neo4j served as an ideal platform for storing, visualizing, and analyzing this character network. By constructing a knowledge graph, I could not only visualize the relationships but also apply graph algorithms like PageRank to identify the most influential characters. This quantitative insight complemented the qualitative extraction, revealing central characters who play key roles in the social structure of the story.<br><br>
<br>
Insight: Pretrained models capture deeper relationships, though at a computational cost. This approach highlights the trade-off between computational efficiency and the quality of extracted relationships, making it suitable for stories with complex character dynamics.

<br>
Limitations: While effective, this approach has limitations in handling ambiguous relationships that may require additional context or external knowledge not present in the text.

<br>
Future Directions: Future work could explore fine-tuning the BERT model for literary text, which may improve extraction accuracy for context-specific relationships. Expanding this approach to other literary texts or genres could also validate its versatility and refine the methods further.

<br>This lab reinforced the power of combining natural language processing and graph analysis for uncovering insights within narrative structures. Such an approach has promising applications not only in literary analysis but also in areas like social network analysis, sentiment analysis, and content recommendation systems.<br> <img alt="Character" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/Character.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/data-analysis/big-data-analysis/lab/bda-lab-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Data Analysis/Big Data Analysis/Lab/BDA-Lab-2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/uT1f9K.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/uT1f9K.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[PageRank]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>In the decision-making process of movie investments, predicting box office performance is a critical step. By analyzing key factors, investors can reasonably evaluate a movie’s box office potential before production, which helps guide production and marketing strategies. This not only increases the movie's box office potential but also enables investors to make optimal decisions given limited resources (such as selecting the right actors, determining the marketing budget, etc.).<br><br><br>Causal inference is the process of identifying and understanding the cause-and-effect relationships between variables.<br><br>
<br>Two variables might show a high degree of correlation, but that does not mean there is a causal relationship between them.
<br>For example, there may be a high correlation between increased ice cream sales and drowning incidents during the summer, but ice cream sales are not the cause of drowning. This type of error often occurs in traditional correlation-based analyses.
<br><br>
<br>Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.
<br>For example, in the figure below, the graph illustrates the relationship between Cholesterol levels (y-axis) and Exercise (x-axis).
<br><img style="zoom:33%;" alt="Simpson paradox" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/j3QKin.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>Intuitively, Exercise and Cholesterol levels are positively correlated.<br><img style="zoom:33%;" alt="Figure" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AllenYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/Figure.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>Each eclipse is a group of age, for each age group, Exercise and Cholesterol are negatively correlated.<br><br><br>In traditional box office prediction methods, researchers often use correlation analysis to identify relationships between various variables (e.g., actors, directors, movie genres) and box office outcomes. However, correlation does not imply causation; even if two variables show strong correlation, it does not necessarily mean that one variable causes the other to change. For instance, there might be a high correlation between a movie's marketing budget and box office performance, but an increase in the marketing budget might not be the direct cause of increased box office revenue, as other hidden factors (e.g., the quality of the movie itself) may also play a role. Therefore, reliance on correlation in traditional models might lead to misjudgments and fail to accurately capture the true drivers of box office results.<br>To better identify and understand these complex relationships, Pearl (2009) proposed causal inference theory, which provides foundational tools for modeling causal relationships in complex systems[6]. The core idea of causal inference is to distinguish correlation from causation and to describe causal relationships between variables using mathematical models.<br>In Pearl's causal inference theory, Causal Graphical Models (CGM) are important tools for depicting causal relationships. Causal graphs are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where nodes represent random variables and edges represent causal influences. Through this graph structure, researchers can identify which variables are drivers of causal relationships and which are confounders or mediators. Causal inference typically involves the following key steps:<br>
<br>Representation of Causal Structure: Using a causal graph model to show the direct and indirect impacts of different movie attributes (e.g., genres, actors, marketing budgets) on box office results.
<br>Estimation of Causal Effects: Quantifying the strength of causal relationships using instrumental variables or counterfactual inference methods.
<br>Handling of Confounding Factors: Using causal inference to control factors that might confound causal relationships during prediction.
<br>A typical application of causal inference is using counterfactual analysis to evaluate whether the box office would have decreased if the marketing budget had not been increased. Such analyses provide decision-makers with stronger explanatory power than correlation analysis.<br>In movie box office prediction, multiple variables may influence each other. For instance, an actor's fame might directly affect box office revenue, while a movie's marketing budget might be related to both the choice of actors and the increase in audience awareness, indirectly affecting the box office. Therefore, it is necessary to use a causal graph model to depict the complex relationships between these variables and identify the main drivers of box office results.<br>Specific steps in applying causal graph models in movie box office prediction might include:<br>
<br>Identification of Key Variables: Such as movie genre, director, cast, marketing budget, and release schedule.
<br>Construction of Causal Structure: Connecting these variables with directed edges to show potential causal relationships. For example, the movie genre might affect the size of the target audience, while the fame of the actors might enhance the movie's market appeal.
<br>Inference of Causal Effects: Quantifying the impact of each variable on the box office through the model, avoiding confusion of causal order.
<br>For example, a causal graph might assume that the marketing budget is a dependent variable influenced by movie genre, cast, and release schedule, while the box office is the joint outcome of the marketing budget, release schedule, and cast. Such a causal structure can help understand how different factors collectively affect movie box office revenue and quantify their causal effects.<br>As deep learning has become widely used in big data, Louizos et al. (2017) further explored the possibility of inferring causal effects in high-dimensional data by combining causal inference with deep learning models[7]. Traditional causal inference methods might face difficulties in handling large-scale and complex data, especially when there are many confounding variables, making the identification of causal relationships unclear. To address this, Louizos et al. proposed using deep latent variable models to identify potential causal structures and infer causal effects in high-dimensional data.<br>Specifically, deep learning models can automatically extract latent features from complex movie metadata or sentiment analysis results and combine them with a causal inference framework, effectively identifying and estimating causal relationships in high-dimensional, complex data environments. The key advantage of this combined approach is:<br>
<br>Representation Learning of High-Dimensional Data: Extracting higher-order features through deep learning from complex movie metadata or sentiment analysis results, such as historical box office performances of actors or audience rating trends of movies.
<br>Estimation of Causal Effects: Identifying the direct and indirect impacts of these higher-order features on movie box office revenue through the causal inference framework.
<br>This method's strength lies in its ability to identify potential causal relationships in massive movie data and sentiment analysis data, avoiding the traditional issues of relying solely on correlation analysis. Especially in movie box office prediction, deep learning models can better capture nonlinear and complex causal effects.<br>Compared to traditional correlation analysis, causal inference in movie box office prediction offers the following advantages:<br>
<br>Avoidance of Confounding Effects: Traditional correlation analysis might mistakenly treat some superficially related variables as driving factors, while causal inference can control confounding variables through causal graph models to accurately identify true causal relationships.
<br>Enhanced Predictive Explanability: Causal inference not only provides predictive outcomes but also explains how each variable influences the box office through causal chains, offering decision-makers more transparent and specific recommendations.
<br>Decision Support: Through counterfactual inference, causal inference can help analyze the potential impacts of different decision scenarios on the box office, providing better decision support for movie production and marketing strategies.
<br>Causal inference and causal graphical models offer new perspectives and tools for movie box office prediction. Compared to traditional correlation analysis methods, causal inference not only uncovers deeper causal relationships between variables but also provides decision support based on causal relationships for movie investors.<br><br>In the field of movie box office prediction, scholars have extensively explored how to use different data sources and methods to improve prediction accuracy. Building on this, this paper focuses on reviewing related work in movie box office prediction using causal analysis methods, covering methods based on metadata, text analysis, sentiment analysis, and causal inference. These studies provide a solid foundation for building a Causal Graphical Model (CGM) in this project.<br><br>Predictions based on movie metadata are one of the most common methods, where researchers use basic information such as directors, actors, film genres, budgets, and schedules to build machine learning models.<br>Predictions based on movie metadata commonly employ various pre-production features (e.g., directors, actors, genres, budgets, release schedules) to construct predictive models. These data provide valuable insights for box office predictions. Common metadata includes:<br>
<br>Directors and Screenwriters: The influence and fame of directors’ past works may significantly impact box office results.
<br>Cast: The star effect is considered one of the main factors in attracting audiences.
<br>Movie Genre: Different genres, such as action, romance, or science fiction, attract varying audience demographics.
<br>Budget: Both production and marketing budgets can directly influence the quality and market exposure of a movie.
<br>Release Schedule: The choice of release timing (e.g., holidays, summer blockbusters) significantly affects a movie’s box office performance.
<br>These features are typically input into machine learning models as independent variables to predict box office outcomes (often the opening weekend or total gross).<br>Zhang et al. (2021) utilized these metadata to predict box office performance using multiple regression, decision trees, and neural networks, demonstrating the contributions of different metadata features to movie success[1]. Duan et al. (2008) revealed the impacts of various movie attributes on box office by analyzing panel data from online reviews and metadata[2].<br>Common machine learning models used include multiple regression, decision trees, random forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and neural networks. Here are some commonly used models:<br><br>This model assumes the box office is a linear combination of movie metadata, with the prediction formula:<br><br>where  is the predicted box office,  is the intercept,  are regression coefficients, and  represent features such as directors, actors, and movie genres. The regression model minimizes error using the least squares method:<br><br>where  is the actual box office value, and  is the predicted value.<br><br>Decision trees predict the box office by recursively splitting the dataset into multiple subsets. Each split chooses the feature that maximizes information gain. The information gain formula is:<br><br>where  is the entropy of the dataset ,  is the feature used for splitting,  are the subsets after splitting, and  are the possible values of feature .<br><br>Random forests are ensemble learning models based on decision trees. They enhance prediction accuracy by averaging (for regression tasks) or voting (for classification tasks) outputs from multiple decision trees. This model is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional data.<br><br>SVMs create a hyperplane to separate samples in feature space for classification or regression tasks. In box office prediction, the regression form of SVM (SVR) minimizes prediction errors by maximizing the margin, with the objective function:<br><br>satisfying:<br><br>where  is the weight vector,  are input features,  is the bias,  is the actual box office value, and  is the tolerated error margin.<br><br>Neural networks model complex relationships between features through multiple layers of nonlinear transformations. They typically output a predicted box office value. A simple single-layer neural network formula is:<br><br>where  is an activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid),  is the weight vector,  are input features, and  is the bias. Neural networks minimize loss functions (e.g., mean squared error) through backpropagation:<br><br><br>Bayesian regression introduces concepts of prior and posterior probabilities in regression analysis. It models regression coefficients with prior knowledge, resulting in a probability distribution of predicted box office values rather than a single prediction. The Bayesian regression formula is:<br><br>where  is the posterior probability given data ,  is the likelihood function, and  is the prior distribution of regression coefficients.<br><br>The flourishing of social media and online movie reviews has made comment data an important resource for movie box office predictions. Audience comments on social platforms, blogs, and review websites not only reflect their attitudes towards movies but also provide a source of sentiment data for box office predictions.<br>Duan et al. (2008) explored the relationship between the sentiment polarity of reviews and box office by combining sentiment analysis with comment data[2].<br>Since then, researchers have explored how to extract valuable information from large amounts of text data through sentiment analysis techniques to predict movie box office performance.<br>Liu (2012) proposed sentiment analysis technology as a crucial tool in this field[3]. The core of sentiment analysis is to break down comment texts into sentiment polarity (positive/negative) and emotion intensity to identify the audience's attitude towards movies. The main steps in sentiment analysis include:<br>
<br>Text Preprocessing: Removing stopwords, punctuation, and noise data, and tokenizing the text.
<br>Sentiment Lexicon Matching: Mapping words in the text to their corresponding sentiment polarities and intensities using a sentiment lexicon (e.g., SentiWordNet).
<br>Sentiment Classification: Classifying text sentiment using machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, deep learning models) or rule-based methods.
<br>Sentiment Aggregation: Aggregating sentiment information from individual comments to score the overall movie sentiment, such as calculating the proportion of positive reviews or the average sentiment score.
<br>This method not only quantitatively measures the overall sentiment of the audience towards the movie but also provides a new dimension for predicting box office success—whether the audience's emotional feedback correlates with commercial success.<br>Mishne and Glance (2006) demonstrated the potential of sentiment analysis in box office prediction through an early study analyzing sentiment data from blogs and review websites[4]. They extracted sentiment polarities from online reviews and compared them with movie box office data, finding a close relationship between sentiment tendencies and first-week box office performance. Specifically, their model used the following core indicators:<br>
<br>Sentiment Tendency Distribution: Analyzing the proportion of positive and negative comments in reviews.
<br>Trend of Comment Sentiment: Observing changes in sentiment during the movie's release period to identify concentrated bursts of negative reviews (e.g., receiving initial praise but a surge in negative reviews later).
<br>Emotion Intensity and Audience Engagement: Quantifying audience engagement by analyzing the word count and tone intensity of comments.
<br>These sentiment analysis indicators provide valuable auxiliary information for box office predictions, especially in understanding the reasons behind box office fluctuations when market performance is below expectations.<br>Asur and Huberman (2010) further extended the application of sentiment analysis to social media data, particularly platforms like Twitter. They found that the volume of movie-related discussions and sentiment tendencies could significantly predict box office performance[5]. The study used two key social media indicators:<br>
<br>Discussion Volume: Reflecting the movie's exposure and level of attention on social platforms. Higher discussion volumes generally indicate higher audience interest and expectations.
<br>Sentiment Tendency: Classifying the overall sentiment atmosphere towards the movie through sentiment analysis algorithms to determine whether the general sentiment is positive or negative.
<br>Specifically, the study showed that pre-release discussion volume and sentiment tendencies could predict the movie's first-week box office in advance, often more accurately than traditional market research and advertising effectiveness predictions. This model of prediction based on social media sentiment analysis provides strong support for movie marketing.<br>Sentiment analysis is often combined with other metadata (e.g., actors, genres, budgets) to construct hybrid models that enhance the accuracy of box office predictions. By incorporating sentiment<br> analysis data as one of the model inputs, researchers can capture immediate audience feedback and combine it with traditional movie features to make more accurate box office predictions. For example, Sharma and Shrivastava (2019) proposed a hybrid machine learning model that significantly improved box office prediction effectiveness by combining movie metadata with sentiment analysis data.<br><br>The research in the field of movie box office prediction has integrated various data sources such as metadata, online comments, and social media, and employed various machine learning methods. With the development of causal inference and causal graphical models, box office prediction is no longer merely dependent on correlations between variables but can identify the true influencing factors through causal analysis. These studies provide more tools and methods for future movie box office predictions, aiding investors in making better decisions with limited resources.<br><br>

<br>Choosing a low number of bins

The two peaks of the original distribution are no longer visible, and one gets the wrong impression that the distribution is unimodal.


<br>Choosing a high number of bins

Usually leads to a very scattered histogram in which it is difficult to distinguish true peaks from random peaks.

<br>MySQL：作为主要的持久化数据存储，处理复杂的查询和事务。
<br>Redis：作为缓存层，存储常用或频繁访问的数据，如用户会话、热门商品信息等。
<br>示例：<br>
<br>用户请求数据时，首先检查 Redis 缓存。如果缓存中存在，则直接返回数据；否则，从 MySQL 中读取数据，并将结果存储在 Redis 中以供下次请求使用。
<br><br>场景：存储用户会话数据，实现快速访问。<br>
说明：<br>
<br>MySQL：存储用户的持久性数据，如用户信息、订单历史等。
<br>Redis：存储会话数据（如登录状态、购物车内容等），利用其快速读写特性实现高效的会话管理。
<br>示例：<br>
<br>用户登录时，将会话数据存储在 Redis 中，设置适当的过期时间。用户请求过程中，频繁访问 Redis 获取会话数据。
<br><br>场景：处理异步任务和消息传递。<br>
说明：<br>
<br>MySQL：存储任务或消息的详细信息和处理结果。
<br>Redis：使用其列表（list）或发布/订阅（pub/sub）功能实现消息队列，处理异步任务。
<br>示例：<br>
<br>电子商务网站中，订单生成后，将订单处理任务放入 Redis 队列，后台服务从队列中取出任务进行处理。

<br>NoSQL数据库是一种非关系型数据库，它不遵循传统的关系数据库管理系统（RDBMS）的结构。
<br>NoSQL数据库的设计初衷是为了解决大规模数据集的存储和检索问题，特别是在分布式环境中。
<br>NoSQL数据库适用于需要处理大量数据、高吞吐量和灵活数据模型的应用程序，例如大数据应用、实时分析、内容管理系统等。
<br><br>
<br>
键值存储（Key-Value Stores）:

<br>这种类型的数据库通过键值对来存储数据，键是唯一的，用于检索值。
<br>例子：Redis, Riak


<br>
文档存储（Document Stores）：

<br>文档存储数据库存储类似于JSON或XML的文档，这些文档可以包含多种数据类型和结构。 

<br>例子：MongoDB, CouchDB




<br>
列存储（Column Stores）：

<br>列存储数据库将数据存储在列中，而不是行，这使得它们非常适合处理大量的写入操作和列查询。
<br>例子：Cassandra, HBase


<br>
图形数据库（Graph Databases）：

<br>图形数据库用于存储实体之间的关系，非常适合社交网络、推荐系统等需要处理复杂关系的应用。
<br>例子：Neo4j, OrientDB


<br><br><br>
<br>关系型数据库

<br>中心化的
<br>处理密集，结构化的数据
<br>满足 ACID 性
<br>遵循 CA 原则


<br>NoSQL

<br>去中心化的
<br>处理稀疏数据，半/非结构化的数据
<br>主要是查询，很少更新
<br>满足 BASE 性
<br>遵循 AP 或 CP 原则


<br><br>CAP定理，也称为布鲁尔定理（Brewer's theorem）
是由计算机科学家埃里克·布鲁尔在2000年提出的一个概念，用来描述分布式系统在设计时需要做出的权衡。
<br> 一致性（Consistency）
在分布式系统中，当一个数据项更新后，所有节点应保证对该数据项的读取都将得到更新后的值。也就是说，如果一个节点更新了数据，其他节点在读取时也应该得到这个最新的数据。
<br>可用性（Availability） 
系统在任何时候都能够响应客户端的请求。即使在部分节点失败的情况下，系统仍然能够提供服务。
<br>分区容错性（Partition Tolerance） 
系统在网络分区（即网络中的一部分节点无法与其他节点通信）的情况下仍然能够继续运行。
<br>CAP 定理 - 最多可以处理三个属性中的两个属性
CAP定理的核心观点是，在任何给定时间，一个分布式系统最多只能同时满足上述三个特性中的两个。这意味着设计者必须在这三个特性中做出选择：

<br>CA: 如果选择一致性和可用性，系统将无法容忍网络分区，一旦发生分区，系统将无法继续服务。SQL
<br>CP: 如果选择一致性和分区容错性，系统在网络分区的情况下将无法保证所有请求都能得到响应。 MongoDB, HBase, Redis
<br>AP: 如果选择可用性和分区容错性，系统将无法保证在所有节点上数据的一致性，可能会采用最终一致性模型。 CouchBD, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak

<br>在NoSQL数据库中，CAP定理的重要性体现在：

<br>设计决策：

<br>NoSQL数据库的设计者和开发者需要根据CAP定理来决定数据库的架构，特别是当面对大规模分布式系统时。


<br>性能优化：

<br>在分布式系统中，为了提高性能和可扩展性，很多NoSQL数据库选择了可用性和分区容错性，牺牲了强一致性，采用最终一致性模型。


<br>应用场景：

<br>不同的NoSQL数据库根据其应用场景和需求，可能在CAP定理的三个特性中做出不同的权衡。例如，一些数据库可能更注重一致性，而另一些则可能更注重可用性和分区容错性



<br><br>高可用性（High Availability）
高可用性是指系统在面对硬件故障、软件故障、网络问题或其他问题时，仍能继续运行并提供服务的能力。在NoSQL数据库中，高可用性通常通过以下方式实现：
副本：数据在多个节点上进行复制，以便在主节点故障时，其他副本可以接管服务。<br>
故障转移：系统能够自动检测到节点故障，并迅速将请求重定向到健康的节点。<br>
冗余：通过在不同的物理位置或服务器上存储数据副本，减少单点故障的风险。
<br>可扩展性（Scalability）
可扩展性是指系统能够通过增加资源(如服务器、存储或处理能力)<br>
来应对增长的工作负载。NoSQL数据库的可扩展性通常分为两种：

<br>垂直扩展（Vertical Scaling）：通过增加单个服务器的资源（如CPU、内存） 来提升性能。
<br>水平扩展（Horizontal Scaling）：通过增加更多的服务器或节点来分散负载，这是NoSQL数据库的常见扩展方式，允许系统几乎无限地扩展以处理更大的数据量和更高的并发请求。

<br>分布式系统（Distributed System）
分布式系统是由多个物理或逻辑上分离的计算机组件组成的系统，这些组件通过网络相互连接和通信，协同工作以完成复杂的任务。在NoSQL数据库的上下文中，分布式系统的特点包括：
数据分布：数据被分割并存储在多个节点上，以实现负载均衡和冗余。<br>
网络通信：节点之间通过网络进行数据交换和协调。<br>
容错性：系统设计能够处理节点或网络的故障，确保整体服务的连续性。<br>
一致性：尽管数据分布在多个节点上，系统仍需保证数据的一致性，可能是强一致性或最终一致性。<br>
并发控制：系统需要管理多个用户或进程同时对数据进行读写操作，避免冲突和数据损坏。
<br><br>
<br>键值存储(Key-Value Store)

<br>简洁：数据主要采用Key-Value(KV)形式储存
<br>高速：数据驻留内存，重启时可再次加载进行使用
<br>易扩展：根据系统负载量，灵活添加或删除服务器
<br>对键可设置失效时间


<br>列存储 (Column Store)

<br>更好的可扩展性
<br>高可用性
<br>适合离线批量数据处理


<br>文档数据库(Document Store)

<br>核心概念是 "文档 "的概念，它与 RDBMS 中的行相对应
<br>以某些标准格式或编码封装和编码数据，如 JSON（BSON）
<br>文档在数据库中通过代表该文档的唯一密钥进行处理
<br>将文档作为一个整体处理，避免将文档拆分为其组成的名称/值对
<br>文档是无模式的，可以是非结构的数据


<br>图形数据库(Graph Store)

<br>面向图形
<br>一切都以边、节点或属性的形式存储
<br>每个节点和边可以有任意数量的属性
<br>节点和边都可以贴标签
<br>标签可用于缩小搜索范围


<br><br><br>a. 实时分析：<br>
适用数据库：列族数据库（如Canssandra）<br>
原因：优化了时间戳索引和快速的数据插入与查询，适合实时数据的收集和分析。全文搜索引擎则提供了强大的文本处理和搜索能力，适合实时日志分析和监控。<br>
b. 大数据处理：<br>
适用数据库：列存储数据库（如Cassandra, HBase） 或 文档数据库（如MongoDB）。<br>
原因：列存储数据库优化了列的读写操作，适合处理大规模数据集，特别是在需要快速列查询的场景。文档数据库则因其灵活性和丰富的查询功能，适合处理结构化或半结构化的大数据。<br>
c. 社交网络：<br>
适用数据库：图形数据库（如Neo4j, OrientDB）。<br>
原因：社交网络中存在大量的用户关系和交互数据，图形数据库能够高效地存储和查询这些复杂的关系，支持社交网络中的好友关系、社交图谱分析等。<br>
d. 物联网 (IoT)：<br>
适用数据库：键值数据库（如Redis） 或 文档数据库（如MongoDB）。<br>
原因：物联网设备产生大量的非结构化，时序数据库可以高效地存储和查询这些数据。同时，物联网数据通常是半结构化的，文档数据库的灵活性使其成为处理这类数据的理想选择。<br><br>实际应用场景：社交媒体平台<br>
应用描述：<br>
一个社交媒体平台允许用户创建个人资料、发布状态更新、分享图片和视频、关注其他用户以及参与评论和点赞等社交互动。<br>
<br>数据模型的灵活性：<br>
社交媒体平台的数据结构经常变化，例如用户资料、帖子、评论等，它们可能是半结构化的，包含多种数据类型。NoSQL数据库如MongoDB允许灵活的数据模型，无需预先定义严格的模式。
<br>水平扩展性：<br>
社交媒体平台可能迅速增长，需要处理大量用户和数据。NoSQL数据库如Cassandra设计用于水平扩展，通过增加更多节点来处理更大的数据量和用户请求。<br>
高性能的读写操作：<br>
用户生成内容和实时交互需要快速响应。NoSQL数据库通常提供高性能的读写操作，特别是在分布式环境中。
<br>高可用性：<br>
社交媒体平台需要24/7的高可用性。NoSQL数据库通过数据复制和故障转移机制，确保服务的持续可用性。
<br>处理非关系型数据：<br>
社交媒体数据如用户关系图、内容推荐等，是高度互联的非关系型数据。图形数据库如Neo4j可以有效地存储和查询这些复杂的网络关系。
<br>大规模数据处理：<br>
社交媒体平台产生的数据量巨大，包括用户生成的内容、日志数据等。使用Hadoop或Spark等大数据处理框架与NoSQL数据库结合，可以高效地处理和分析这些数据。
<br>多样化的查询需求：<br>
社交媒体平台需要支持复杂的查询，如搜索、推荐、趋势分析等。NoSQL数据库提供了丰富的查询语言和API，可以满足这些需求。
<br>成本效益：<br>
与关系型数据库相比，NoSQL数据库通常提供更灵活的部署选项，包括云服务，这有助于降低成本和提高资源利用率。
<br>开发速度：<br>
社交媒体平台需要快速迭代和部署新功能。NoSQL数据库的灵活性有助于加速开发过程，减少模式变更的复杂性。<br>
通过上述原因，社交媒体平台选择使用NoSQL数据库而不是关系型数据库，可以更好地满足其业务需求，提供更好的用户体验，并支持快速增长和变化

<br><br>Redis 排序集是字符串的非重复集合，与 Redis 集类似。<br>
其中，排序集的每个成员都与一个分数相关联，该分数用于将排序集从小到大排序。<br>
虽然分数可以重复，但成员和集合一样是唯一的。<br>对排序集进行添加、删除或更新等操作的速度非常快（执行时间与元素数量的对数成正比）。<br>
由于元素是按顺序提取的，而不是事后排序，因此还可以通过得分或排名（位置）快速获取范围。<br>
总之，使用排序集，可以以极佳的性能完成许多任务，而这些任务在其他类型的数据库中很难实现。<br>
<br>ZADD: 向排序集添加一个或多个成员，或更新其分数（如果存在）。

<br><br>Redis 实现了发布/订阅（Publish/Subscribe）消息传递范式，在这种范式中，发送者（发布者）不需要向特定的接收者（订阅者）发送消息。<br>
<br>
相反，发布的消息被归类到频道中，而不知道有哪些订阅者。

<br>
订阅者对一个或多个频道表示兴趣，只接收感兴趣的信息，而不知道有哪些发布者。

<br>这样可以实现更高的可扩展性和更动态的网络拓扑结构。<br>一旦进入订阅模式，Redis-cli 将不接受任何命令，除非使用 Ctrl+C 退出该模式。<br><br>
<br>SUBSCRIBE: 监听发布到指定频道的信息。
<br>SUBSCRIBE [Chanel1] [Chanel2] [Chanel3]
<br>
<br>PSUBSCRIBE : 订阅与给定模式匹配的频道。
<br>PSUBSCRIBE pattern1 [pattern2]
<br>
<br>例如：订阅所有 带News 的频道。
<br>PSUBSCRIBE *News
<br>
<br>UNSUBSCRIBE： 从指定频道取消订阅客户端，如果没有指定频道，则从所有频道取消订阅。
<br>UNSUBSCRIBE [Chanel1] [Chanel2] [Chanel3］

<br>
<br>PUNSUBSCRIBE：从符合给定模式的频道中取消订阅客户端。
<br>PUNSUBSCRIBE pattern1 [pattern2] (取消订阅模式)
<br>
<br>在 Redis 中，当客户端在命令行下工作时，处于订阅状态的客户端不接受任何命令，因此按下 Ctrl-C 时会自动取消订阅所有通道。
<br><br>向频道发布消息。<br>PUBLISH &lt;channel&gt; &lt;message&gt;
<br><br>Redis 事务允许在一个步骤中执行一组命令。<br>
事务中的所有命令都被序列化并按顺序执行。<br>
在执行 Redis 事务的过程中，绝不会出现其他客户端发出的请求被送达的情况。<br>
这就保证了命令是作为一个单独的操作执行的。<br>要么处理所有命令，要么不处理任何命令，因此 Redis 事务也是原子性的。<br>
EXEC 命令会触发事务中所有命令的执行。<br>
如果客户端在调用 MULTI 命令之前，在事务上下文中失去了与服务器的连接，则不会执行任何操作。相反，如果调用 EXEC 命令，则会执行所有操作。<br>MULTI:  标记一个事务块的开始。<br>MULTI 
SET Name Mark
SET Age 25	
INCRBY Age 5
GET *
<br>EXEC: 执行所有事务块内的命令。<br>EXEC
<br><br>
<br>
Redis.conf 是 Redis 配置文件，可用于配置 Redis 的各个方面。

<br>
Redis 的每个版本都有一个文档详尽的 redis.conf 文件。

<br>
示例文件包含默认配置选项，有助于了解这些设置的作用和默认值。

<br>
config set 命令可用于设置配置文件中的各个值。

<br>config set CONFIG_SETTING_NAME
<br>
<br>config get 命令用于显示某个设置的值。
<br>config get CONFIG_SETTING_NAME
<br>
<br>可以使用以下命令查看 Redis.conf 中的所有可用设置：
<br>config get *

<br>安装 Cassandra (此处采用 homebrew 包管理器进行安装)
<br>brew install cassandra
<br><br>
<br>MacOS 后台启动 Cassandra
<br>brew services start cassandra
<br>
<br>命令行启动 Cassandra
<br>cqlsh
<br><br>
<br>命令行关闭 Cassandra
<br>exit	
<br>
<br>MacOS 后台关闭 Cassandra
<br>brew services stop cassandra
<br><br>Cassandra 是：<br>
<br>一种开源、可线性扩展、分布式和容错的 NoSQL 数据库。设计用于处理海量数据。
<br><br>主要特点：	<br>
<br>大规模可扩展架构
<br>无主架构
<br>线性扩展性能 
<br>无单点故障 
<br>故障节点可轻松恢复
<br>具有灵活、动态的数据模型，可调整的数据一致性，多数据中心复制 
<br>数据压缩效率高
<br><br>
<br>传统关系型数据库面向行设计，内部组织结构围绕行的处理，适合 OLTP场景
<br>Cassandra 列族数据库面向列设计，主要处理列，适合 OLAP 场景
<br><br>复制策略是指 Cassandra 如何在集群中复制数据，放置数据副本<br><br>Cassandra 提供两种复制策略，包括SimpleStrategy 和 NetworkTopologyStrategy<br>
<br>SimpleStrategy 用于只有一个数据中心的情况。SimpleStrategy 会在分区器选择的节点上放置第一个副本。之后，其余副本按顺时针方向放置在节点环中
<br>NetworkTopologyStrategy 用于有多个数据中心的情况。在网络拓扑策略中，会为每个数据中心分别设置副本。网络拓扑策略在环中按顺时针方向放置副本，直到到达另一个机架中的第一个节点
<br><br>
<br>Cassandra 使用标记删除的方式，而不是立即删除数据。标记删除的数据会在后续的清理过程中删除。<br>
注意的地方：
<br>如果标记删除的数据过多，会影响查询性能，因为查询时需要扫描和过滤这些标记删除的数据。
<br>需要注意Cassandra表的TTL（生存时间）设置，如果TTL设置不当，可能导致大量的tombstone积累。
<br><br>Cassandra Query Language（CQL）是 Cassandra 数据库的查询语言。<br><br>Apache Cassandra 的设计目标主要围绕着可扩展性、高可用性和无单点故障展开。<br><br>Cassandra 的主要成分包括：	<br>
<br>节点
<br>数据中心
<br>集群
<br>分区器
<br><br>社交媒体的评论管理<br>
Cassandra 面向列设计，适合处理大量数据，适合社交媒体评论管理场景，可以快速写入和读取评论数据，支持高并发读写操作。	]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/database-management-system/nosql/cassandra.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Database Management System/NoSQL/Cassandra.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Neo4j]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:DataBase" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#DataBase</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:NoSQL" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#NoSQL</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:Neo4j" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#Neo4j</a>

<br>节点（事物）和边（关系）的集合，其中边为节点对的连接

<br>适用于任何相关数据


<br>可在节点和关系上附加属性（键值对）与关系
<br>关系连接两个节点，节点和关系都可以保存为任意数量的键值对
<br><br>
<br>Neo4j 是一个高度可扩展的原生图数据库，不仅可以利用数据，还可以利用数据之间的关系。
<br>图形（即网络）是处理数据的最高效、最直观的方式，它模仿了人类头脑中思想的相互联系。Neo4j 从底层开始构建，旨在利用图形的力量来实时洞察底线。
<br>它采用直观的适应性数据建模技术。
<br>使用图形查询语言 Cypher
<br>Neo4j是一个数据库 

<br>用它来可靠地存储信息并在以后查找它
<br>Neo4j的数据模型是图，尤其是属性图


<br><br><br>
<br>安装 Neo4J (此处采用 homebrew 包管理器进行安装)
<br>brew install neo4j
<br><br>
<br>MacOS 后台启动 Neo4j
<br>brew services start neo4j
<br>
<br>命令行启动 Neo4j
<br>cypher-shell
<br>
<br>输入用户名密码
<br><br><br>
<br>退出命令行
<br>:exit
<br>
<br>关闭 MacOS后台服务
<br>brew services stop neo4j
<br><br>Cypher 是一种声明式图形查询语言，可以对图形存储进行高效的查询和更新。<br>
<br>Cypher 借鉴了 SQL 的结构，使用各种子句建立查询。
<br>Cypher是Neo4j的图形查询语言（图的SQL！）
<br>Cypher 是一种声明式查询语言：它描述的是你感兴趣的内容，而不是如何获取这些内容。
<br>Cypher 具有很强的可读性和表现力
<br><br>
<br>Node 节点
<br>Relationship 关系
<br>Property 属性
<br>Label 标签
<br><br>
<br>Cypher 使用一对括号（通常包含一个文本字符串），如 (), (foo) 来表示一个节点
<br>最简单的形式是（），表示一个匿名的、未表征的节点。
<br>引用其他地方的节点，添加一个变量：（matrix）
<br>Movie 标签（前缀为冒号）说明了节点的类型或作用。
<br>属性可用于存储信息和/或限制模式。例如，我们可以 MATCH 和 RETURN 标题为 "The Matrix "的节点。
<br><br>
<br>标签允许我们对节点进行分组
<br>Cypher 使用标签来更好地决定如何优化查询
<br>MATCH (node:Label) RETURN node
<br>MATCH(node1:Label) -[:REL_TYPE]-&gt; (node2:Label) RETURN node1, node2
<br><br>
<br>关系是一个节点指向另一个节点的箭头，就像 -&gt; 或 &lt;- 。但我们可以根据需要在一对方括号中添加有关它们的细节。
<br>MATCH(node1:Label) -[:REL_TYPE]-&gt; (node2:Label) RETURN node1, node2
<br>MATCH(node1:Label) -[REL:TYPE]-&gt; (node2:Label) RETURN rel.property
<br><br><br>CREATE(node: Label {key:value, ...})
<br>CREATE (n:Person {name: 'Allen', age: 20})
<br><br>MATCH (n:Label {key:value})	
SET n.key = value
<br><br>MATCH (n1:Label {key:value}), (n2:Label {key:value})	
CREATE (n1)-[r:RELATIONSHIP]-&gt;(n2)
<br><br>MATCH (n:Label {key:value})	
REMOVE n.key
<br><br>
<br>DELETE  Node
<br>MATCH (n:Label {key:value})	
DELETE n
<br>
<br>DELETE Node and Relationship
<br>MATCH (node {Property:Value})  
DETACH DELETE node
<br>MATCH (a:Label {Property: value}) 
OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[r]-()				 
DELETE a, r
<br>MATCH会返回空<br>
OPTIONAL MATCH 即使没有匹配到也会返回 NULL<br><br><br>
<br>在 Cypher 中，使用 ORDER BY 命令很容易对结果进行排序。
<br>比方说，我们想显示数据库中年龄最大的人。我们可以使用下面的查询：
<br>MATCH (person:Person)
RETURN person.name, person.born
ORDER BY person.born
<br>
<br>也可以使用 DESC 关键字来指定降序排序：
<br>MATCH (person:Person)	
RETURN person.name, person.born	
ORDER BY person.born DESC
<br>
<br>升序
<br>MATCH (person:Person)
RETURN person.name, person.born	
ORDER BY person.born ASC
<br><br>
<br>Cypher 支持对记录集进行简便的分页。
<br>它使用 LIMIT 和 SKIP 语句来减少返回记录的数量，并允许对结果进行分页。
<br>LIMIT: 限制返回的记录数
<br>SKIP: 跳过指定数量的记录	
<br>MATCH (person:Person)	
RETURN person.name, person.born		
ORDER BY person.born DESC
SKIP 10 LIMIT 5	
<br>SKIP 10 LIMIT 5	<br>
<br>从第 10 条记录开始，返回 5 条记录
<br><br>
<br>通常，我们要求查询只返回不同的结果
<br>MATCH (person:Person)	
RETURN DISTINCT person.born
<br><br>
<br>
选中的节点与边组成的字符串

<br>
起点和终点都是节点

<br>
查找图中与Gene Hackman合作过的演员

<br>MATCH (gene:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&gt;()&lt;-[:ACTED_IN]-(other:Person)
WHERE gene.name="Gene Hackman"
RETURN distinct other
<br>
<br>查找所有电影相关演职人员的三种写法
<br>MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&gt;(movie:Movie)&lt;-[:DIRECTED]-(director:Person)
RETURN actor.name, movie.title, director.name;
<br>MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&gt;(movie:Movie),
      (movie)&lt;-[:DIRECTED]-(director:Person)
RETURN actor.name, movie.title, director.name;
<br>MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&gt;(movie:Movie),(director:Person)-[:DIRECTED]-&gt;(movie)

RETURN actor.name, movie.title, director.name;
<br><br>
<br>
跨越任何深度的关系是： (a)-[*]-&gt;(b)

<br>
特定深度关系的表示方法是：(a)-[*深度]-&gt;(b)，以查找所有深度步长的路径。

<br>
1到4层深度的关系是这样表示的： (a)-[*1..4]-&gt;(b)

<br>
距离 3 层的 KNOWS 类型关系：(a)-[:KNOWS*3]-&gt;(b)

<br>
2 层 KNOWS 或 LIKES 类型的关系：(a)-[:KNOWS|:LIKES*2...]-&gt;(b)

<br>MATCH p =(actor { name: 'Tom Hanks' })-[:ACTED_IN*2]-(co_actor)
RETURN relationships(p)
<br><br>
<br>最短路径是两个节点之间的最短路径。
<br>MATCH
	(tom:Person { name: 'Tom Hanks' }),
	(kevin:Person { name: 'Kevin Bacon' }), 
	p = shortestPath((tom)-[*..15]-(kevin))
RETURN p
<br><br>
<br>
Neo4j 不使用索引来加速 JOIN 操作

<br>
有助于通过值、前缀或范围查找起点

<br>
创建特定于标签的索引，因为索引绑定到具体的标签-属性组合上

<br>
示例：根据电影标题有效搜索

<br>CREATE INDEX ON :Movie(title)
<br>
<br>要删除索引，请使用以下 Cypher 命令
<br>DROP INDEX ON :Movie(title)
<br><br>
<br>在标有 "人 "的节点上创建索引，按属性名称建立索引：
<br>CREATE INDEX ON :Person(name)
<br><br>
<br>COUNT(x) 
<br>MIN(x)
<br>MAX(x)
<br>AVG(x)
<br>SUM(x)
<br>COLLECT(x) 
<br>MATCH (person:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-&gt;(movie:Movie)
RETURN person.name, collect(movie.title)
<br><br>
<br>LOAD CSV 语句可将本地或远程文件解析为表示映射（带标题）或列表的一系列行。
<br>使用任何 Cypher 操作来创建节点或关系，或与现有图结构合并
<br>由于 CSV 文件通常表示节点或关系列表，因此需要执行多次操作，分别创建节点和关系。
<br>示例，查询使用 movies.csv 中的数据作为属性创建电影节点
<br>LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS 
FROM "" AS line 
CREATE (:Movie {id: line.id, title: line.title, released: toINT(line.year)})

<br>Not Only SQL 
<br>NoSQL 是一个总称 不遵循 RDBMS 原则的数据库和数据存储 

<br>一类产品
<br>有关数据存储和操作的多个（相关）概念的集合 
<br>通常与大型数据集有关



<br>为什么不用RDBMS
在互联网背景下 

<br>RDBMS 假定数据是

<br>密集
<br>基本一致（结构化数据）


<br>来自互联网的数据是

<br>大量且稀疏
<br>半结构化或非结构化


<br>面对海量稀疏数据集，典型的存储机制和访问方法变得捉襟见肘 

<br>稀疏的非/半结构化数据 
<br>高水平可扩展性



<br><br><img alt="NoSQL" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Database/NoSQLType.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>

<br>针对大型数据集的查询进行了优化，将数据列（而不是行）存储在一起


<br><br>
<br>面向图形
<br>一切都以边、节点或属性的形式存储
<br>每个节点和边可以有任意数量的属性
<br>节点和边都可以贴标签 
<br>标签可用于缩小搜索范围
<br>适用场景: 网络型

<br>社交网络
<br>金融领域
<br>交通网络
<br>计算机通信网络
<br>智能电网
<br>...


<br><br>
<br>核心概念是 "文档 "的概念，它与 RDBMS 中的行相对应 
<br>以某些标准格式或编码封装和编码数据，如 JSON（BSON） 
<br>文档在数据库中通过代表该文档的唯一密钥进行处理
<br>将文档作为一个整体处理，避免将文档拆分为其组成的名称/值对
<br>数据库提供 API 或查询语言，可根据文档内容检索文档 
<br>文档是无模式的，也就是说，不同的文档可以有不同的结构和模式(RDBMS 要求每一行都包含相同的列）
<br>适用场景：评论型

<br>内容管理系统
<br>电子商务平台
<br>社交网络
<br>日志管理系统
<br>...


<br><br>
<br>以无模式方式存储数据
<br>以映射方式存储数据 

<br>哈希映射或关联数组 
<br>为访问数据提供非常高效的平均运行时间算法


<br>特点

<br>简洁：数据主要采用Key-Value(KV)形式储存
<br>高速：数据驻留内存，重启时可再次加载进行使用
<br>易扩展：根据系统负载量，灵活添加或删除服务器
<br>对键可设置失效时间


<br>适用场景

<br>缓存
<br>用户会话管理
<br>分布式锁
<br>分布式配置管理
<br>分布式存储系统


<br><br>
<br>
以列为导向的方式存储数据

<br>有效存储数据 
<br>避免消耗空间来存储空值
<br>以列族对列进行分组
<br>数据不存储为单一表格，而是按列族存储
<br>数据单位是一组键/值对

<br>用 "行键 "标识
<br>根据行键排序与筛选




<br>
特点

<br>更好的可扩展性
<br>高可用性
<br>适合离线批量数据处理
<br>支持跨平台部署


<br>
适用场景

<br>数据仓库
<br>数据挖掘和商业智能
<br>实时数据分析
<br>大规模数据集成


<br><br>NoSQL 解决方案设计用于在集群或多节点数据库解决方案上运行<br>
<br>如果数据量/操作量较大，则需要在集群中添加更多机器，即 "向外扩展 "或 "水平扩展"。
<br>不同的方法包括

<br>主从（Master-slave）
<br>分片（Sharding）


<br><br>分布式存储系统必然存在如下三方面问题 <br>
<br>一致性（Consistency）

<br>每个客户端都有相同的数据视图


<br>可用性（Availability）

<br>每个客户端始终可以读写


<br>分区容错性（Partition Tolerance）或稳定性

<br>系统在分布式物理网络中运行良好


<br><br>
<br>满足CA原则：系统几乎没有或根本没有分区容错性。一致性和可用性优先

<br>RDBS


<br>满足AP原则：一致性受到影响，但系统始终可用，并且在部分分区时也能工作

<br>CouchBD, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak


<br>满足CP原则：可用性受到影响，但一致性和分区容错性优于可用性

<br>MongoDB, HBase, Redis


<br>没有完美的 NoSQL 数据库<br>
<br>每个数据库都有其优缺点
<br>取决于要完成的任务类型（和偏好） 

<br>NoSQL 是一套处理以下问题的概念、想法、技术和软件


<br>大数据
<br>稀疏的非/半结构化数据

<br>高水平可扩展性
<br>大规模并行处理


<br>不同的应用、目标、对象和方法需要不同的 NoSQL 解决方案
<br><br>
<br>原子性 Atomicity
<br>一致性Consistency
<br>隔离性Isolation
<br>持久性Durability
<br>
<br>NoSQL 

<br>不重视 ACID 特性，在某些情况下完全忽略


<br>在分布式并行系统，很难/不可能确保 ACID 属性
<br><br>
<br>基本可用性 Basically Available
<br>软状态 Soft State
<br>最终一致 Eventually Consistent
<br>
<br>特点

<br>弱一致性可用性优先
<br>尽最大努力
<br>近似答案
<br>进取（乐观）
<br>更简单、更快速


<br><br>
<br>
NoSQL分布式集群系统由多个节点构成

<br>
由于网络异常、服务器故障等原因，节点并不总能保证正常工作

<br>
分布式系统采用多数据副本来保证可用性

<br>
严格一致性 

<br>
“读己之所写”一致性

<br>
会话一致性

<br>
单调读一致性

<br>
最终一致性

<br>argmax
<br>softmax
<br><br>The argmax function returns the index of the maximum value in a given array or function. Mathematically, it can be represented as:<br><br>
<br>简单的说, 有一个数组, argmax 会找到最大数字的下标
<br>Example
给定数组如下

<br>
<br>argmax 将会返回3，因为最大值 在数组的下标是3

<br>
<br>优点在于可以简单直接的解释输出
<br>缺点在与argmax不可导，不可用于训练模型
<br>所以一般可以用argmax输出，softmax训练<br><br>The softmax function converts a vector of values into probabilities, such that the sum of all probabilities equals 1. The formula for softmax is:<br><br>Where:<br>
<br>
 is the  element of the input vector.

<br>
 represents the exponential of the  element.

<br>
The denominator is the sum of the exponentials of all elements in the input vector.

<br>
这种转换在多类分类问题中特别有用，其中softmax函数的输出表示不同类的预测概率。

<br>Example
给定数组如下

<br>
<br>softmax函数将返回一个概率向量:<br>

<br>Prompt-based learning (inference)
<br>A new paradigm in Deep Learning / Machine Learning (NLP, CV)
<br>Encouraging a pre-trained model to make particular predictions by providing a “prompt” that instructs the model to perform the task effectively

<br>The General workflow of Prompting:	<br>
<br>Prompt Addition 
<br>Answer Prediction (Search)
<br>Post-process the answer
<br><br>
<br>
Given input , this component modifies the input into a prompt 

<br>Append a textual string to the input


<br>
Contains two step 

<br>Define a template with two slots 

<br>An input slot  for input  
<br>An answer slot  for an intermediate generated answer  that will later be mapped into label

<br>Modified small part of parameters of pretrained models
<br>Add extra parameters
<br>Add increment of parameters of pretrained models 

<br>LoRA, FACT


<br><br><br>Only modify (retraining) part of parameters of pretrained models <br>
<br>Bias and the final linear layer
<br>Pros 

<br>Simple, but efficient, comparable to full model fine-tuning 
<br>Can learn downstream tasks sequentially, which helps to deploy efficiently 
<br>For each downstream task, only very small number of parameters should be stored 


<br>For BERT backbone, 0.1% parameters are modified (retrained)

<br><br><br>Idea 
Add Adapter module to each layer of pretrain models
<br><br>Idea
Use prefixs, which can be learned and specific to given tasks, to mimic prompts
<br><br>Idea 

<br>Construct a prompt for each task, concatenate the prompt with data to input to Large Model 
<br>Only add prompt (tokens) at input layer, no MLP A Simplified version of Prefix Tuning

<br><br><br>Cons of previous tuning methods 

<br>Adapter Tuning adds Adapter layer in Transformer, which makes the model more deeper and increases the inference time 
<br>Prompt-based methods, such as Prefix Tuning and Prompt Tuning, are hard to train. In addition, the prompt token occupy the input space so as to decrease the number of available tokens

<br><br>Off the top of my head, I would like to talk about a time I was late for an interview for a peer mentor program in my university.<br>So… this happened when I was applying to be part of the peer mentor program at my university. <br>Basically, this interview was important to me because being a peer mentor would allow me to help incoming students transition to university life, provide academic guidance, and foster a supportive community. It was a chance to develop my leadership and communication skills while making a positive impact on others.  I would say it was pretty much a big deal.<br><br>Speaking of which, just a few days before the interview, I unfortunately contracted COVID-19. I started experiencing symptoms like fever and fatigue, which made it difficult for me to prepare for the interview and focus on the tasks at hand.<br>So, one thing led to another, and I had to quarantine myself at home to recover and prevent spreading the virus to others. As a result, I was unable to attend the interview in person and ended up being late for the scheduled time.<br>As a result, I missed the chance to participate in the peer mentor program that year.<br>Overall, the experience taught me the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of unexpected challenges. I learned to prioritize my health and find alternative ways to pursue my goals, such as applying for the program again in the future once I had fully recovered.<br><br><br>Speaking of which, what happened was that… (固定开头)<br>时间顺序: <br>

 <br><br><br>Do you like eating chocolate? Why or why not?
Yes, I do enjoy eating chocolate.<br>
I find it to be a delightful treat, especially when I want something sweet. Chocolate has a rich and smooth texture that’s very satisfying.<br>
Plus, it’s a nice little indulgence that can brighten up my day, especially after a long study session. However, I try to enjoy it in moderation since it can be quite sugary.
<br><br>Is there anything that has made you feel happy lately?
Yes, recently I completed a project that I’d been working on for quite some time.
It was a challenging task, but seeing it come together and getting positive feedback made me feel really accomplished and happy.

Firstly, the robots could greatly improve the efficiency that when people face some repetitive and monotonous tasks.

Moreover, the robots can replace some dangerous work that only human can do in the past. For example, repairing high voltage cable is undoubtedly a dangerous job for people. Using robots to finish this kind of work may greatly save people's life.<br>
Lastly, some people argued that the robots may completely replace all of the human jobs. Admittedly, It is true that robots are now can handle a great number of difficult tasks.

 <br><br><br>There is a lot of pressure on young people today to succeed academically. As a result, some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from the school syllabus so that children can concentrate on academic work.<br>To what extent do you agree or disagree?<br><br>In the modern age, the topic of whether non-academic subjects should be removed from the class has sparked considerable debate. Personally, I strongly disagree that removing physical education or cookery from school syllabus.  <br>Admittedly, it seems true that students can concentrate on academic work without non-subjects disturb. This mainly because students may spend more time on studying or improve their exam performance. However, this notion is biased, as children may lose their concentration on study tasks after a long time study. The study efficiency would become lower and lower. In addition, boring study life may easily made student become annoy. It is harmful for their future development.  <br>Secondly, non-academic subject education can borden their horizons and improve their ability in other aspects. For example, cookery may largely improve their life skills. Physical courses can play an important role for teenagers to keep their health. Besides, doing exercise regularly may help students get rid from heavy study tasks and truly release their pressure from academic training.  <br>Moreover, non-academic subject education may help some students become more confident, especially students that can not have good performance on academic subjects. Each person may have different advantages on some fields.  Some students are good at physical courses. It may encourage them easily find their interests.  <br>In conclusion, I firmly believe non-academic subjects should be removed from daily courses in the school, because students have rights to find some interesting thing other than studying. And non-academic subjects may improve their all-round ability and help them adapt their future life.<br><br>

 <br><br>Nowadays some older people choose to live in the retirement communities with other people rather than living with their adult children. Is it a positive or negative development?<br><br><br>In recent years, there has been a growing trend of older people choosing to live in retirement communities with other individuals rather than living with their adult children. This trend has sparked a debate about whether it is a positive or negative development. In my opinion, I believe that it is a positive development for several reasons.<br><br>Firstly, living in a retirement community provides older individuals with the opportunity to maintain their independence and freedom. By living with other people who are in a similar stage of life, they are able to engage in social activities and form new friendships, which can enhance their overall well-being. Additionally, retirement communities typically offer a range of amenities and services that cater to the specific needs of older people, such as recreational activities, healthcare facilities, and assistance with daily tasks. This can help to improve their quality of life and provide them with the support they need as they age.<br>Furthermore, living in a retirement community can alleviate the burden on adult children who may have their own families and responsibilities to tend to. By living independently, older individuals can relieve their children of the financial and emotional strain that often comes with providing care for aging parents. This can lead to better family dynamics and reduce potential conflicts that may arise from living under the same roof.<br>Lastly, retirement communities can also foster a sense of community and belonging among older individuals. By living with others who share similar experiences and challenges, they can find comfort and companionship in their peers. This can help to combat feelings of isolation and loneliness that are common among older individuals, ultimately leading to a greater sense of happiness and fulfillment.<br><br>In conclusion, the choice of older individuals to live in retirement communities rather than with their adult children is a positive development. It provides them with the opportunity to maintain their independence, relieves their children of potential burden, and offers a sense of community and support. As the population continues to age, retirement communities can play a crucial role in promoting the well-being and happiness of older individuals.<br><br>in a similar stage of life<br>sb relieve sb of sth<br>

<br>Admittedly, it seems true that the elderly living in the retirement community, the chance that they can see their adult children is less, leading to less communication and estrangement.<br>
However, this notion is incorrect,  although the elderly live in the retirement community, they still live in the same city as their adult children, and children can visit them frequently, or keep in touch through phone/social media. Moreover, living separately can reduce conflicts, and have their own freedom/space, which is beneficial to family relationship.]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/english/ielts/write/task2/write-lesson.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/IELTS/Write/Task2/WRITE Lesson.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[IELTS Write Substitute word]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 The two graphs are isomorphic.<br><br>
<br>Base Case (n = 1):<br>
For a cube of dimension n = 1, we have 2 vertices connected by an edge. We can easily divide these two vertices into two separate sets, forming a bipartite graph.<br>
For a cube of dimension n = 2, we have 4 vertices connected by an edge. We can easily divide these two vertices into two separate sets like  forming a bipartite graph. 
<br>Inductive Hypothesis:<br>
Assume that a cube  of dimension k is bipartite, where k ≥ 1.
<br>Inductive Step:<br>
Now we need to show that a cube  is also bipartite. Consider a cube , which is obtained by adding one layer of vertices to the cube . Let's call this additional layer "L". Each vertex in layer L is connected to exactly one vertex in the cube . Now, we can divide the vertices of  into two sets, S₁ and S₂.<br>
Next, we assign each vertex in layer L to the opposite set of its connected vertex in . In other words, if a vertex in L is connected to a vertex in S₁, we assign it to S₂, and vice versa. This assignment ensures that no two vertices within the same set (S₁ or S₂) are adjacent, including the newly added layer L.<br>
Therefore, we have successfully divided the vertices of  into two sets, S₁ and S₂, such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. Hence, by induction, we can conclude that a cube  of dimension n is bipartite for n ≥ 1.

Determine whether the following relations are equivalence relation. You need to prove your answer. If yes, list all distinct equivalent classes (each subset of the partition defined by the equivalence relation).

<br>a) on ;

if   (x mod 5=x）  R is reflexive<br>
if   (x mod 5=y)  y mod 5 may not be x<br>
 is not symmetric  is not equivalence relation

<br>b){(x,y)| x and y are two UIC students and from the same faculty/school.} on the set of all UIC students;

 For reflexive, the same student must be in the same faculty/school as himself/herself, so R satisfies reflexivity
 For symmetric, if student a and student b are from the same faculty/school, then student b and student a are from the same faculty/school, then (a, b) ∈ R, (b, a) ∈ R, so R satisfies symmetric.
 For transitive, if (a, b) ∈ R, (b, c) ∈ R, then will have (a, c) ∈ R, so R satisfies transitive.  
 ∴ this relation is equivalence relation.

<br>c){| there is a bijection } on  is the powerset of . So, A and B are subsets of .

 For reflexive, let A = B, that will have a bijection : A → B, so R satisfies reflexivity<br>
For symmetric, if : A → B is a bijection, then : B → A is a bijection, it means that if<br>
(A, B) ∈ R, that will also have (B, A) ∈ R, so R satisfies symmetric<br>
For transitive, if : A → B is a bijection, : B → C is a bijection, then it will always have<br>
ℎ: A → C is a bijection, so R satisfies transitive.<br>
∴ this relation is equivalence relation. equivalent classes are all  that can have bijection relation to every

 <br><br>
<br>A tree is a connected undirected simple graph that contains no simple circuits.
<br><br>
<br>A rooted tree is a tree in which one node has been designated the root.
<br>Every edge is directed away from the root.
<br>Given a vertex 𝑣 in a rooted tree 𝑇:

<br>Parent: unique vertex 𝑢 such that (𝑢, 𝑣) is an edge (in the direction from root to 𝑣)
<br>Child: any vertex for which 𝑣 is a parent
<br>Siblings : vertices with the same parent
<br>Ancestors : all vertices from root to 𝑣 (except itself)
<br>Descendants : vertices with 𝑣 as an ancestors


<br>A vertex of a tree is called a leaf if it has no children.
<br>Vertices that have children are called internal vertices.
<br>
Rooted Trees（有根树）是一种基础的数据结构，它由若干个节点和连接这些节点的边组成。它们通常用于表示层次结构，例如文件系统、网站导航、家谱等。根据定义，每个树都有一个根节点，它是唯一的，并且没有父节点。每个节点可以有零个或多个子节点，每个子节点都连接到其父节点。树的节点可以表示任何对象，可以是简单的值（例如数字或字符串），也可以是更复杂的对象或数据结构。节点可以具有任意数量的子节点，但每个节点最多只能有一个父节点。
<br><br>
<br>A Game (State) Tree models the different possible outcomes in a game.

<br>Vertices: positions (states) in a game.
<br>Edges: legal moves from one position (state) to another.
<br>Leaves: Final positions (states) of a game.


<br>eg: Tic-Tac-Toe
<br><br>
<br>A rooted tree is called 𝑚-ary if every internal vertex has no more than 𝑚 children (maximum is 𝑚).
<br>It is called full if every internal (non-leaf) vertex has exactly 𝑚 children.
<br>A 2-ary tree is called a binary tree. If 𝑣 is an internal vertex of a binary tree, it has at most two children. The first we call the left child and the second the right child.
<br>If vertex 𝑣 is in a tree 𝑇, the sub-tree with root 𝑣 is the tree consisting of 𝑣 and all its descendants.
<br>
m-ary Tree是一种树形数据结构，它的每个节点最多有m个子节点。m通常被称为树的度。当m=2时，m-ary Tree就是二叉树；当m=3时，m-ary Tree就是三叉树。m-ary Tree常用于计算机科学中的搜索和排序算法，例如B树和B+树，它们被广泛应用于数据库和文件系统的实现中。在m-ary Tree中，节点的度数可以任意，而不像二叉树那样只能是2，因此m-ary Tree可以更灵活地表达数据结构和算法的特点。
<br><br>The level of a node is the length of the path from the root to the node (The level of the root is defined to be zero).<br>
<br>The height of a tree is maximum level of node.
<br>A rooted m-ary tree with height ℎ is called balanced if all leaves are at levels ℎ or ℎ − 1.
<br><br>
<br>Rooted trees are used to store information.

<br>We often need to do some operation on the vertices in such a tree.
<br>A tree traversal (遍历) is an algorithm designed to “visit” each node in the tree.


<br>Traversal Algorithms

<br>Pre-order traversal
<br>In-order traversal
<br>Post-order traversal


<br><br>
<br>先序遍历可以想象为，一个小人从一棵二叉树根节点为起点，沿着二叉树外沿，逆时针走一圈回到根节点，路上遇到的元素顺序，就是先序遍历的结果
<br><img alt="Pre-order" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Pre-orderTraversal.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>中序遍历可以看成，二叉树每个节点，垂直方向投影下来（可以理解为每个节点从最左边开始垂直掉到地上），然后从左往右数，得出的结果便是中序遍历的结果
<br><img alt="In-order" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/In-orderTraversal.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>后序遍历就像是剪葡萄，我们要把一串葡萄剪成一颗一颗的。
<br>还记得我上面提到先序遍历绕圈的路线么？（不记得翻上面理解）<br>就是围着树的外围绕一圈，如果发现一剪刀就能剪下的葡萄（必须是一颗葡萄）（也就是葡萄要一个一个掉下来，不能一口气掉超过1个这样），就把它剪下来，组成的就是后序遍历了。<br><img alt="Post-order" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Post-orderTraversal.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>A spanning tree of a connected undirected graph 𝐺 is a subgraph of 𝐺 that contains all of 𝐺’s vertices and enough of its edges to form a tree.
<br>To obtain a spanning tree from a connected undirected graph with cycles.
<br>Remove edges until there are no cycles.
<br>There are two algorithms for constructing spanning trees.

<br>Depth-First Search (Back-tracking)
<br>Breadth-First Search


<br><br>
<br>
Depth-First Search (DFS) proceeds along a path from a vertex 𝑣 as deeply into the graph as possible before backing up (back tracking).

<br>
To create a depth-first search (DFS) spanning tree

<br>
Traverse the graph using a depth-first search and mark the edges that you follow.

<br>
After the traversal is complete, the graph’s vertices and marked edges form the spanning tree.



<br><img alt="DFS" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DFS.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>Breadth-First Search (BFS) visits every vertex adjacent to a vertex v that it can before visiting any other vertex.
<br>To create a breath-first search (BFS) spanning tree

<br>Traverse the graph using a bread-first search and mark the edges that you follow.
<br>When the traversal is complete, the graph’s vertices and marked edges form the spanning tree.

<img alt="BFS" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/BFS.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>
<br>A minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree that has the smallest possible sum of weights of edges.

<br>There may be several different minimum spanning trees for a particular graph. But the minimum weight is unique.


<br><br>
<br>
Initially, starts from an empty (no vertices, no edges) sub minimum spanning tree 𝑇.

<br>
Randomly put a vertex 𝑣 into 𝑇.

<br>
Among all the edges (𝑢, 𝑠) such that 𝑢 is in 𝑇 and 𝑠 is not in 𝑇, find the one of the minimum weight. And add the edge and the endpoint to 𝑇.

<br>
Repeat Step 3 for 𝑛 − 1 iterations (because a tree has 𝑛 − 1 edges).

<br>  <img alt="Prim's Algorithm" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Prim's%20Algorithm.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>
Initially, starts from a subgraph of all vertices but no edges.

<br>
Find the edge with the smallest weight.

<br>
If adding the smallest edge to the subgraph does not create any cycle, add it. (To maintain the tree property.)

<br>
Otherwise, this edge is not in the MST. So, discard the edge.

<br>
Repeat steps 2-4 until for 𝑛 − 1 iterations (because a tree has 𝑛 − 1 edges).

An Euler path in G is a simple path containing every edge of G.（不需回到起点）

An Euler circuit in a graph G is a simple circuit containing every edge of G.(回到起点)

<br>If G has no vertex of degree below 5, G is not a planar-graph.

<br>
对于一个连通的简单平面图G，如果它有e条边和v个顶点，其中v &gt; 3，则e ≤ 3v - 6。也就是说，如果e &gt; 3v - 6，则G不是平面图。<br>
如果一个连通的简单平面图G没有度数小于5的顶点，则G不是平面图。<br>

<br>Relationships exist in our daily life
<br>A relation is a structure that is used to represent the relationships between elements.
<br>Category of relations

<br>Binary relations
<br>N-ary relations


<br><br>
<br>A binary relation R from the set 𝐴 to the set 𝐵 is a subset of 𝐴 × 𝐵.

<br> is a set of ordered pairs in the form (𝑎, 𝑏) where 𝑎 is from 𝐴 and 𝑏 is from 𝐵.
<br>𝑎 𝑅 𝑏 denotes (𝑎, 𝑏) ∈ 𝑅, called 𝑎 is related to 𝑏 by 𝑅.


<br><br>
<br>There are several other ways to represent relations

<br>Tables
<br>Matrices
<br>Graphs


<br><br>
<br>All the functions are relations.
<br>It is not the case that all the relations are functions.
<br>Functions are the specialization of relations.
<br>Relations are the generalization of functions.
<br><br>
<br>A relation on a set 𝐴 is a relation from 𝐴 to 𝐴.
<br><br><br>
<br>A relation 𝑅 on a set 𝐴 is called reflexive if (𝑎, 𝑎) ∈ 𝑅 for every element 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴.
<br><br>
<br>A relation 𝑅 on a set 𝐴 is called symmetric if (𝑏, 𝑎) ∈ 𝑅 whenever (𝑎, 𝑏) ∈ 𝑅.
<br><br>
<br>A relation 𝑅 on a set 𝐴 is called anti-symmetric if whenever (𝑎, 𝑏) ∈ 𝑅 and (𝑏, 𝑎) ∈ 𝑅, then 𝑎 = 𝑏<br>
(i.e, if 𝑎 ≠ 𝑏 and (𝑎, 𝑏) ∈ 𝑅 then (b, 𝑎) $\notin $𝑅)
<br><br>
<br>A relation 𝑅 on a set 𝐴 is called transitive if whenever (𝑎, 𝑏) ∈ 𝑅 and (𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝑅, then (𝑎, 𝑐) ∈ 𝑅.
<br><br>
<br>𝑅: a relation from 𝐴 to 𝐵.
<br>𝑆: a relation from 𝐵 to 𝐶.
<br>The composite of 𝑅 and 𝑆 (𝑆 ◦ 𝑅): consisting of all ordered pairs (𝑎, 𝑐) where 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴, and 𝑐 ∈ 𝐶 if there exists 𝑏 such that (𝑎, 𝑏) ∈ 𝑅 and (𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝑆.
<br><br>
<br>Let 𝑅 be a relation on the set 𝐴. The powers 𝑅𝑛for integer 𝑛 with 𝑛 &gt; 0 are defined recursively by

<br>
<br>


<br>For example

<br>𝑅 = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)}
<br> = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)}
<br>𝑅 ◦ 𝑅 = {(1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2)}


<br>Theorem:

<br>The relation 𝑅 on a set 𝐴 is transitive if and only if  for 𝑛 = 1, 2, 3, ⋯

<br>Steps in Design of Logical Circuits (Without minimization)
<br>
<br>Find the inputs and outputs

<br>Inputs: number of variables in the Boolean function
<br>Outputs: how many functions are required


<br>Draw the truth table

<br>Truth table: indicate the relationship between outputs and inputs
<br>Specify what ‘0’ and ‘1’ (in input and output) in the table represent?


<br>Figure out the functions

<br>Use sum of products or product of sums


<br>Design the logical circuits
<br><br>
<br>Add two bits

<br>0 + 0 = 0
<br>0 + 1 = 1
<br>1 + 0 = 1
<br>1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1 to the next place

<br>Definition:<br>
A graph G = is a pair and consists of two sets V and E such that

<br> is the set of vertices and
<br> is the set of edges.


<br>V cannot be empty, E cannot be empty.
<br>A vertex can also be called an endpoint (node).
<br>Each edge has one or two vertices.
<br><br>
<br>A graph is a simple graph if:

<br>each edge connects two different vertices and
<br>where no two edges connect the same pair of vertices.


<br>
简单图是一种没有自环和重复边的图。也就是说，在简单图中，每条边连接两个不同的点，且同一对顶点之间只有一条边。
<br><br>
<br>A multigraph is a graph that may have multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices.
<br>If there are m different edges associated to the same unordered pair of vertices.
<br>
Multigraph（多重图）是一种有重复边的图。也就是说，在Multigraph中，两个顶点之间可以有多条边。<br>
在图论中，Multiplicity（重数）指的是一条边在一个图中出现的次数。在简单图中，每条边的重数为1，而在Multigraph中，一条边的重数可以大于1。
<br><br>
<br>A loop is an edge that connects one vertex to itself.
<br>Graphs that may include loops, and possibly multiples edges connecting the same pair of vertices are called pseudo-graph.(伪图)
<br>
在图论中，Loop（自环）是一条连接同一个顶点的边。自环的两个端点是同一个顶点。在简单图中不存在自环，但在Multigraph中可以存在自环。自环的重数为自环的数量。
<br><br>
<br>A directed graph (V, E) consists of a nonempty set V and a set of directed edges E.
<br>The edge (u, v) in a directed graph starts at u and ends at u.
<br>The edge (v, u) starts at v and ends at u.
<br>The edges in an undirected graph have no direction.
<br><br><br>
<br>The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges connected with it except that a loop at a vertex contribute twice to the degree of that vertex.

Countable set: it consists of countable number (finite or countably infinite) of elements. For example, the set of even numbers is countably infinite; the set of prime numbers under 10,000 is finite.

<br>
Uncountable set: it consists of uncountable number of elements. For example, the number of real numbers in any interval (a, b); the set of possible outcomes from measuring human weight or height.

<br><br>Experiments<br>
<br>Many investigations may be characterized in part by the fact that repeated experimentation.
<br>Each experiment terminates with an outcome.
<br>Suppose that we have such an experiment, the outcome of which can’t be predicted.
<br>If this kind of experiment can be repeated under the same conditions, it is called a random experiment.
<br>The collection of every possible outcome is called the experimental space or the sample space.

<br>Poisson distribution

<br>


<br>Intuitively, the Binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution seem to be unrelated. But a closer look reveals a very interesting relationship. The Poisson distribution is just a special case of the binomial distribution. When n tends to infinity and p approaches zero, the binomial distribution approaches the Poisson distribution.<br>As you can see on the slide,  intuitively the 2 distributions seem to be unrelated. However, by searching on the internet. We found an interesting relationship between the Binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution. That is when the trail n tends to infinity.  The Poisson distribution is just a special case of the binomial distribution.
<br><br>Let me give you a simple derivation<br>For binomial distribution<br>
<br><br>
 

<br> represents the number of trails
<br> represents the probability that a trial will succeed


<br>As you can see the binomial distribution on the slide, the expected value of the binomial distribution is equal to the variable n times the probability p. So we can get p by lambda divided by n.
<br>Put the equation in the expression for the binomial distribution， we can get the following expression<br>$ C^k_n \ (\frac{\lambda}{n})^k \ (1-(\frac{\lambda}{n}))^{n-k} $<br>And we put this equation to the binomial distribution, we can get the following expression 
<br>By expanding the combination number<br><br>There is an assumption in the Poisson distribution<br>For Poisson distribution  <br><br>For the Poisson distribution, the variable n tends to the infinity
So we just need to simplify this limit expression
<br>We can expand the factorial， then cancel out the (n-k)factorial part<br><br>After that, we switch the positions of the denominators<br><br>We can see that the factorial part has k terms， and we have n k times<br><br><br><br><br>This part can be divided into two terms<br><br><br><br><br>According to the definition of the natural constant e<br><br><br>It can be found that the base part is the same as the definition<br>]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/math/probability-statistics/poisson-distribution.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Math/Probability Statistics/Poisson-Distribution.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hypothesis-Testing-Two-Population]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>rename命令的使用是rename oldfile newfile matchfile


<br>rename a.txt b.txt a.txt
<br>rename命令的优点是它可以用来批量重命名文件和目录，支持正则表达式。<br>
例如我们想要批量重命名“txt”文件为“log”文件，可以使用以下命令：<br>rename .txt .log *.txt
<br>rename命令支持多种参数，下面介绍一些常用参数:<br>
<br>-v：显示重命名的详细信息
<br>-n：显示模拟执行的结果，但不实际执行
<br>-f：强制执行，忽略存在的文件
<br>-i：忽略大小写
<br>-h：显示帮助信息。

 <br><br>在 C++ 算法竞赛中，标准库中的 algorithm 头文件中的函数是非常常用的。以下是一些常见的 algorithm 库函数，它们在解决各种算法竞赛问题时非常有用：<br>
<br>
排序算法：

<br>sort(): 对容器进行排序。
<br>stable_sort(): 稳定排序。
<br>partial_sort(): 部分排序。
<br>nth_element(): 找到容器中第 n 个元素，其他元素不一定有序。


<br>
搜索算法：

<br>find(): 在容器中查找某个值第一次出现的位置。 无序时使用
<br>count(): 统计某个值在容器中出现的次数。
<br>binary_search(): 二分查找。
<br>lower_bound(): 返回大于或等于给定值的第一个元素的位置。
<br>upper_bound(): 返回大于给定值的第一个元素的位置。


<br>
合并和删除算法：

<br>merge(): 合并两个已排序的容器。
<br>unique(): 删除容器中连续重复的元素。
<br>remove(): 删除容器中指定值的元素。


<br>
其他常见算法：

<br>min(), max(): 返回两个值中的最小值和最大值。
<br>accumulate(): 对容器中的值进行累积操作。
<br>next_permutation(): 获取容器的下一个排列。
<br>prev_permutation(): 获取容器的上一个排列。


<br><br>//在 [first, last) 区域内查找不小于 val 的元素
ForwardIterator lower_bound (ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last,
const T&amp; val);

//在 [first, last) 区域内查找第一个不符合 comp 规则的元素
ForwardIterator lower_bound (ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last,

背景<br>
在使用数组时，有时需要递增地给数组中每个元素赋值。<br>
此时使用iota()函数就十分方便。

<br>
头文件： #include &lt;numeric&gt;

<br>

<br>对于数组


<br>格式：


<br>iota(array, array+length[array], number);
<br>从number开始，分别为数组array数组中各元素递增+1地赋值。<br>eg:<br>#include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&lt;numeric&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int number[10];

    iota(number, number + 10, 66);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    cout &lt;&lt; number[i] &lt;&lt; " ";//输出：66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75
    }
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
<br>从number开始，分别为数组vector容器中各元素递增+1地赋值。<br>

<br>Every variable in a Java program must be declared before it is used<br><br>
<br>Camel Case

<br>Variable and Method names should begin with a lowercase letter. Indicate "word" boundaries with an uppercase letter and restrict the remaining characters to digits and lowercase letters:

<br>topSpeed bankRate1 timeOfArrival


<br>Class names should begin with an uppercase letter and, otherwise, adhere to the rules above:

<br>FirstProgram MyClass String




<br><br>
<br>Local variables
<br>
Local variables are declared (visible) in methods, constructors or blocks. No default value for local variables, therefore should be assigned an initial value before the first use.
<br>局部变量（local variable）是在方法或代码块内部定义的变量，只能在该方法或代码块内部访问。它们的生命周期仅限于该方法或代码块的执行期间。局部变量必须先声明，然后才能使用。在声明时，可以指定变量的类型和初始值。例如：<br>public void exampleMethod() {
    int x = 5; // x是一个局部变量，类型为int，初始值为5
    System.out.println(x); // 输出5
}
<br>
<br>Instance variables
<br>
Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block. Instance variables have default values, e.g., numbers – 0, Boolean – false,etc.
<br>实例变量相当于该类的属性，需要 "new对象 "才能被调用。而且该变量不常驻内存，当这个类不再被使用时会java回收机制所释放。例如：<br>public class ExampleClass {
    int x; // x是一个实例变量，初始值为0
    String str = "hello"; // str是一个实例变量，初始值为"hello"
}
<br>
<br>
实例变量存在默认值：

<br>数值类型（byte，short，int，long，float，double）：0
<br>char类型：'\u0000'（空字符）
<br>boolean类型：false
<br>引用类型（例如String）：null


<br>
Class/static variables

<br>
Class/Static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or blocks.<br>
There would only be one copy of each class variable per class, regardless of how many objects are created from it. Default values are same with instance variables.
<br>静态变量用 static字符修饰，随着类的加载而加载，静态变量存放在方法池中的静态区，可以直接通过"类名.变量名直接"调用，也可以通过类的对象调用。<br>public class ExampleClass {
    static int x; // x是一个静态变量，初始值为0
    static String str = "hello"; // str是一个静态变量，初始值为"hello"
}
int a = ExampleClass.x; // 通过类名访问静态变量x
String s = ExampleClass.str; // 通过类名访问静态变量str
<br><br>
<br>Standard output
<br>System.out.println(); //Print a line to the standard output (screen)
System.out.print(); //Print something to the standard output (screen)
<br>
<br>Standard input
<br>import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int a=input.nextInt();
String b=input.nextline();
Double c=input.nextDouble();

<br>Code libraries in Java are called packages.

<br><br>
<br>The break statement: break;

<br>When executed, the break statement ends the nearest enclosing switch or loop statement.


<br>The continue statement: continue;

<br>When executed, the continue statement ends the current loop body iteration of the nearest enclosing loop statement.
<br>Note that in a for loop, the continue statement transfers control to the update expression.

 <br><br>
<br>Class inheritance is the process by which a new class is created from another class superclass-subclass, parent-child class

<br>Allows code to be reused 允许复用
<br>Subclass automatically has all the non-private instance variables and methods of the superclass 子类自动拥有父类非私有实例变量和方法
<br>Java does not allow multiple inheritance Java不允许多重继承
<br>Static methods cannot be overridden 静态方法不可重写
<br>Have the same method name and parameters and compatible return type
<br>New method cannot narrow the accessibility, but can widen it 只能扩展权限


<br><br><br>
<br>方法重载（Overloading）：在同一个类中定义多个同名但参数列表不同的方法，根据方法调用时传递的参数类型和个数来确定调用哪个方法。这种方式也称为编译时多态或静态多态。
<br>方法名相同
<br>参数列表不同
<br>方法调用更加方便
<br><br>
<br>
方法重写（Overriding）：在子类中重写父类的方法，通过子类对象引用调用该方法时，实际执行的是子类中的方法。这种方式也称为运行时多态或动态多态。

<br>
在继承中，改写父类的方法

<br>
方法名不学相同

<br>
返回参数要兼容

<br>
可访问区间只增大

<br>
Every class inherits the methods from Object and the methods need to be overridden with more appropriate definitions

<br><br>
<br>Calling parent methods using super
<br>super() with correct number of arguments to call the parent constructor  ----super 使用父类构造器方法
<br>this() with correct number of arguments to call current class constructor  ----this 使用本类已经实现的构造器方法
<br>Java implicitly adds a call to super() if the constructor dose not explicitly call super(…) as its first statement
<br><br>
<br>Placed before definition of a variable, the value of this variable cannot be changed; 该变量不可改变
<br>Placed before definition of a method, then that method cannot be redefined (overridden) in a subclass. 该方法不可重写
<br>If the modifier final is placed before definition of a class, then that class cannot have subclasses. 该类不继承
<br><br>
<br>Every class is a descendent of the class Object.所有类的祖先类都是object
<br>toString and equals 方法 所有类都自带该方法
<br><br><br>
<br>The java toString() method is used when we need a string representation of an object.
<br>This method can be overridden to customize the string representation of a specific class.
<br><br>
<br>The equals method compares the object given as argument to the method with the object on which the method is called: object1.equals(object2) compares object1 and object2 using the equals method of object1.
<br>The result may or may not be the same as: object2.equals(object1) because the two objects might be from different classes with different equals methods.
<br>This method can be overridden to customize the comparison of objects for specific classes.
<br>The equals method should always have a parameter of type Object so that we can compare the current object with any other object from any other class:
<br><br>
<br>对于基础数据类型：

<br>直接比较--值


<br>对于引用数据类型：

<br>比较是不是同一个对象


<br>public boolean equals(Object otherObject) {
        ...
}
<br><br>
<br>Connecting a method call to a method body is called binding.
<br>Automatically selecting the appropriate method at runtime is called dynamic binding or late binding.<br>
When binding is performed before the program is run (by the compiler, if there is one), it’s called early binding.
<br>All method binding in Java uses late binding unless the method is static or final (private methods are implicitly final).
<br>When the program runs and uses dynamic binding to call a method, then the virtual machine must call the version of the method that is appropriate for the actual type of the object.

<br>If the actual type class defines the matched method, then the method is called.
<br>Otherwise, the superclass of the actual type class is searched, and so on.
<br>Finally, the Object class is searched.


<br>Multiple implementations of the same method occur in different classes along the same hierarchy.
<br>A child class overrides the implementation of a method<br>
provided by its parent class.
<br>Dynamic binding then uses the first method with the right signature when searching bottom-up in the class hierarchy.
<br>在Java中使用父类或接口为参数的方法/其子类或实现了接口的方法 都可被传参
<br><br>
<br>An object from a subclass can be used as if it were an object from a superclass Subtyping polymorphism: an object from a subclass can be used as if it were an object from a superclass.
<br>Also called the Liskov substitution principle.
<br>Student inherits all the non-private methods of Person.
<br>So a Student object has all the methods necessary to act as a Person object!
<br>So Java allows us to use a Student object in any place where a Person object would work too.
<br><br>
<br>Object typecasting is when the type used for an object is changed, usually by assigning the object to a variable of a different type.
<br>The cast does not change the object itself, it only changes the type through which the object is used.
<br>There are two types of casts:

<br>Upcast: the type of the object is changed to the type of a superclass.
<br>Downcast: the type of the object is changed to the type of a subclass. 本来是父类则无法向下转型


<br><br>
<br>用于检验是不是该类及该类所属的子类
<br>Since the type used for an object can be changed, how do we know what kind of object it really is?

<br>The instanceof operator can be used to test if an object is from a class which is a descendent of the tested class//子类 instanceof 父类---true 父类 instanceof 子类---false
<br>object instanceof class

<br>For compile, class could be parent class/children class, otherwise “incompatible conditional operand types”
<br>For run time, return true if the class is the parent class of the object type; otherwise return false ----运行时才报错

//It is already handled by the catch block for Exception.
<br>
<br>Runtime errors:------编译通过，运行报错,需要程序员立刻处理否则无法运行

<br>Error

<br>Usually unrecoverable, very rare.
<br>Examples: JVM out of memory, hardware error, etc. ——&gt;越界，内存泄漏


<br>Exception：

<br>Often recoverable, fairly common.




<br><br>
<br>An exception in Java is any abnormal

<br>unexpected event
<br>extraordinary condition.


<br>example:

<br>file not found exception
<br>array out of bounds exception
<br>unable to get connection exception


<br>Java is guaranteed to:

<br>Automatically detect that something is wrong.
<br>Immediately stop the program.
<br>Show you an exception about the problem.
<br>Tell you what the exception is about.
<br>Tell you exactly where the exception happened in your code.


<br>Handling the exception

<br>Your Java program may catch the exception object. Your program can then use the object to recover from the problem.


<br>Throwing an exception

<br>When an exception occurs, the JVM automatically creates an object from the class Exception which contains information about the problem. This object represents the exception itself!


<br><br>
<br>The predefined class Exception is the root class for all possible exceptions
<br>Every exception class is a descendent class of the class Exception
<br>Although the Exception class can be used directly in a class or program, it is most often used to define a subclass
<br>The class Exception is in the java.lang package
<br><br><br>
<br>Unchecked exceptions are the class RuntimeException and any of its subclasses.

<br>These exceptions correspond to bugs (divisions by zero, array access out of bounds, etc.) that can happen anywhere in your program.
<br>The compiler does not force the programmer to handle these exceptions.
<br>In fact, the programmers may not even know that these exceptions could be thrown.
<br>Since an unchecked exception corresponds to a bug, it is normal for the program to die (instead of trying to recover from the problem); you must then find the bug in your program and fix it.


<br><br>
<br>Checked exceptions are subclasses of the Exception class, excluding the class RuntimeException and its subclasses.

<br>These exceptions correspond to situation which are unexpected but which are not bugs in the program.

(the network is temporarily down, the hard disk is full, etc.)


<br>These exception can happen at specific places in your program (when opening a network connection, when saving a file, etc.)
<br>The compiler forces the programmer to handle these exceptions in some way (see later). Usually the program can recover from the problem (instead of dying) and keep running.


<br><br><br>The Java code that you think may produce an exception is placed within a try block.<br>
<br>No exception occurs inside the try block → the finally block is executed, then the rest of the method.
<br>An exception occurs inside the try block → an exception object is created by Java and thrown, killing all the code after that inside the try block, until a matching catch block is found and executed to handle the exception object → the finally block is executed → the rest of the method is executed.
<br><br>
<br>An exception object created and thrown during execution of the try block can be caught and handled in a catch block.
<br>On exit from a catch block, normal execution continues and the finally block is executed, followed by the execution of the rest of the method.
<br>// try-catch example:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    while(true) {
        System.out.print("Input an integer: ");
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        try {
          int i = Integer.parseInt(s);
          System.out.println("i is: " + i);
        }catch(NumberFormatException e) {
          System.out.println("Wrong!");
        }
    }
  }
}
<br><br>
<br>A finally block is always executed.
<br>Generally a finally block is used for freeing resources, cleaning up, closing files or network connections etc. Otherwise you do not need it.
<br>If the finally block executes a control transfer statement such as a return or a break statement, then this control statement determines how the execution will proceed regardless of any return or control statement present in the try or catch.
<br>try {
    &lt;code that might throw an exception&gt;
} catch (&lt;exception type1&gt; &lt;parameter1&gt;) {
    &lt;statements handling parameter1&gt;
} catch (&lt;exception type2&gt; &lt;parameter2&gt;) {
    &lt;statements handling parameter2&gt;
}finally { // finally block
    &lt;statements always executed&gt;
}
<br>//finally example:
public class Test3 {
    public static void division(int i, int j) {
        int result = -1;
        try {
            result = i / j;
        } catch(ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Wrong: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println(i + " / " + j + " = " + result);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        division(100, 4);
        division(100, 0); // ArithmeticException: / by zero
        System.out.println("End of main()");
    }
}
<br><br>A method can explicitly create an object from the Exception class (or one of its subclasses) using new and then throw the object using the throw statement. Then the method must either:<br>
<br>Catch the exception object itself using a try-catch statement. 使用try-catch捕获并处理异常

<br>This is not very useful: in general there is little reason for a method to throw an exception just to immediately catch it in the same method...


<br>use the throws clause to specify as part of the type of the method that the method might throw an exception. 在方法名旁边throws特定的异常

<br>The exception object will then have to be caught somewhere else, in  one of the callers of the method.   可以用if-else, 挑出异常，用throw抛出异常


<br><br>
<br>getMessage()

<br>Returns the detailed error message string for this exception object.抛出的异常中写啥，getMessage就返回啥


<br>printStackTrace()

<br>Prints this exception and its backtrace: the list of method calls starting from main up to the method that threw the exception object.


<br>//throw
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (true) {
            System.out.print("Input a positive integer: ");
            String s = scanner.nextLine();
            try {
                int i = Integer.parseInt(s);
                if (i &lt;= 0) {
                    // This is overkill. It is easier to just print the
                    // error message here and then use "continue" to start
                    // the next iteration of the while loop.
                    throw new Exception(i + " &lt;= 0 !");
                }
                System.out.println("i is: " + i);
            } catch (Exception e) { // Catch all exceptions!

            try {
                readPosInt(); // May throw an exception, which we need to catch.
            } catch (Exception e) { // Catch all exceptions!
                System.out.println("Catch: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
<br><br>
<br>In a method, if you throw an exception object and you don’t want to catch the exception object in the same method then you must use the throws clause.
<br>The method might throw multiple different kinds of exceptions: you need to list in the throws clause all the exceptions that the method does not catch itself.
<br>public Type methodName(…) throws &lt;Exception1&gt;,…, &lt;ExceptionN&gt; {
        …
}
<br><br>
<br>Define a subclass of Exception.
<br>Create an exception object from the subclass using new.
<br>Throw the exception object using throw.
<br>Use a try-catch statement to handle the exception object inside the method itself, or use a throws clause and catch the exception object somewhere else.
<br>
public class NotPositiveException extends Exception {
    public NotPositiveException(String msg) {
    // msg is the message given to the exception 
    when
    // it is created, which will later be the 
    resultP
    // of calling the getMessage() method.
    super(msg);
    }
}

    public static void readPosInt() throws NotPositiveException {

<br><br>
<br>An overriding method in subclass can throw any unchecked exception, regardless of whether the  overridden method in superclass throws exceptions  or not.
<br>If an overriding method in subclass throws checked exception, then it must be the same exception or child exceptions of the exception(s) declared in the  overridden method.

<br>An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.
<br>
array 一经创建长度不可变
<br>
<br>Arrays of primitive types.

<br>Declare an array variable by specifying the array type—which is the element type followed by []—and the array variable name.
<br>Initialize the array variable with an actual array. Use new operator to create the array.
<br>The number of elements in the array is stored in a public instance variable of the array object called length.


<br>Declare an array a of integers: 
    int[] a; int b[];
Create an array object that can hold 100 integers:
    a = new int[100];
Array literal:
    int [] array = {1,2,3,4,5}
Length 
    a.length;
<br>
<br>Arrays of objects.

<br>After creating the array object itself, you must also create each element object of the array one by one using the newoperator (inside a loop).


<br>
创建后需要使用 new 方法 初始化对象
<br>    Student[] a; // Variable.
    a = new Student[3]; // Array object.
    System.out.println("length: " + a.length);
// Creating all the array elements one by one:
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {
      a[i] = new Student("Student " + i); //* neeed to new an object
    }
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {
// a[i] is of type Student.
      System.out.println("name: " + a[i].getName());

<br>Internally the Java compiler automatically transformssuch a loop into a normal for loop.
<br>varName is then a synonym (another name) for arrayName[i].
<br>ElementType can be a primitive type or a class type, both work the same way.
<br>Possible to modify the element object
<br>for(Student s: a) {
    System.out.println("name: " + s.getName());

    Student s = a[i];
    System.out.println("name: " + s.getName());
}
<br><br>
<br>It is easier to write
<br>It is easier to read
<br>Less opportunities for indexing errors
<br><br>
<br>Does not modify the content of the array object!
<br>
Because varName is only a synonym for arrayName[i], and is not arrayName[i] itself, modifying varName does not modify the array object!<br>
It is not possible to use an enhanced for loop to modify the array object.<br>
It is possible to use an enhanced for loop to modify the element objects!<br>
element object 可以修改， array 本身不可变
<br>
<br>
The array elements are always all accessed one by one in order of increasing index (from 0 to length - 1) and there is no way to change that.

<br>
Do not confuse the array object with its element objects!

<br><br>
<br>By default the type of the elements of an arraylist is Object.

<br>This allows an arraylist to contain any kind of object.
<br>A downcast is then usually required when reading an element from an arraylist.


<br>ArrayList vs Array

<br>Like an array: an arraylist is an object that can contain other objects. You can access elements of the arraylist using an index that starts at 0.
<br>Like a list, you can grow or shrink the size of the arraylist dynamically by adding or removing elements.


<br>Methods must be used to read / write array elements:

<br>the usual array notation does not work.


<br>Arraylists are mostly used to store objects.
<br>Arraylists can also be used with primitive values:

<br>Java then automatically converts the primitive value into an equivalent object: int becomes Integer, double becomes Double, boolean becomes Boolean, etc.
<br>These classes are provided by Java.
<br>This automatic conversion is called boxing.
<br>The object equivalent to the primitive value is then stored in the arraylist.
<br>Later when taking the object out of the arraylist (and doing a downcast), Java can automatically unbox the object back into the original primitive value.


<br>ArrayList a; // Variable.
a = new ArrayList(); // ArrayList object.
// Loop up to 3 because a.size() is 0 initially.
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
    a.add(new Student("Student " + i)); // Upcast.
}
for(int i = 0; i &lt; a.size(); i++) {
    Student s = (Student)a.get(i); // Downcast.
    System.out.println("name: " + s.getName());
}
<br><br>
<br>Generics are a way to parameterize a class over a type.

<br>A method can take a value as argument.
<br>A generic class can take a type as argument.


<br>We don’t need downcasts anymore when reading elements from an object such as an arraylist.

<br>All type errors can be found at compile time.


<br>Generics are also useful when we have two classes that have exactly the same code but with different types.
<br>Advantages:

<br>There is no need for downcasts anymore, Java knows exactly what kind of value is stored in which box, based on the type of the box itself.
<br>All types can be checked at compile time.
<br>So errors in your code are detected before you ship your software to your customers!
<br>The code runs faster too.
<br>And there is no code duplication.


<br>public class Generics&lt;T&gt;{

    Random random=new Random();
    private T product;
    public ArrayList&lt;T&gt; products=new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    public Generics(){

    }
    public void addproduct(T product){
        products.add(product);
    }
    public T getproduct(){
        product=products.get(random.nextInt(products.size()));
        return product;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Generics&lt;String&gt; sGenerics=new Generics&lt;&gt;();
        String [] sProducts={"Iphone","Iwatch","Mac","airpods"};
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sProducts.length; i++) {
            sGenerics.addproduct(sProducts[i]);            
        }
        System.out.println("You get "+sGenerics.getproduct());    
    }
}
<br>
<br>Generic application

<br>Arraylist is a generic class too
<br>Many of Java’s classes are generic too

<br>lists, queues, trees, hash maps, etc.

<br>
A class is a programmer-defined type.

<br>
A value of a class type is called an object or an instance of the class: an object exhibits the properties and behaviors defined by the object’s class.

<br>
Objects have data and behavior.

<br>Data in an object is called instance fields.
<br>Behaviors that operate on the data are called methods.


<br><br>
<br>A class definition specifies the data items and methods that all of it subjects will have:

<br>Data items and methods are sometimes called members of the object.
<br>Data items are usually called instance fields/instance variables/attributes/properties.


<br><br>
<br>UML : pictures of an Object-Oriented system

<br>Programming languages are not abstract enough for OO design.
<br>Open standard to model the OO system.


<br>The most popular diagrammatic notation used for Object-Oriented Development.
<br>Consists of:

<br>Class diagrams;
<br>Sequence diagrams;
<br>Use case diagrams;
<br>Activity diagrams;


<br><br>
<br>Class name in the top of box
<br>Attributes (optional)

<br>Include all instance fields of the object
<br>visibility name : type


<br>Operations / methods (optional)

<br>visibility name (parameters) : return_type
<br>May omit trivial methods (get/set)


<br>Visibility:

<br>+ public
<br># protected
<br>- private
<br>~ package (default)


<br>Underline static instance variables and static methods<br>
<img alt="ClassDiagram" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/ClassDiagram.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br><br>
In java we use constructors to construct new instances.
<br>
<br>Constructors always have the same name as the class name.
<br>A constructoris a special kind of method that is designed to initialize the instance variables for a new object:
<br>
public ClassName(Parameters){ code }
<br>
<br>A constructor must have the same name as the class.
<br>A constructor has no type returned, not even void.
<br>Constructors are often overloaded. <a data-footref="[inline0" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/about:blank#fn-1-c23061aba9aab184" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a>
<br><br>
The new operator is used in combination with constructor to create an object from a particular class.
<br>&gt; ClassName classVar= new ClassName();
<br>
<br>The object variable refers to the newly constructed object.
<br>
In Java, the value of any object variable is a reference <a data-footref="[inline1" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/about:blank#fn-2-c23061aba9aab184" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a> to an object that is stored elsewhere.
<br><br>
<br>Initialize the object variable with a newly constructed object 创建一个新的对象
<br>Set the variable to refer to an existing object 对存在的对象进行引用
<br>Person person1 = new Person();
Person person2 = person1;
Person person3 = null;       //refers to no object
<br><img alt="MemoryAnalysis" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/MemoryAnalysis.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>Define:<br>
[&lt;modifiers&gt;] type &lt;fields_name&gt; [= defaultValue] 定义在类里，方法外的变量
<br>In order to refer to a particular instance variable, preface it with its object name as follows:
<br>person1.name // "." is the period operator
person2.age
<br>

<br>instance variables store the data of the object.
<br>Each object has its own copy of the variables.
<br>Every object has a state that is determined by the values stored in the instance variables of the object.

<br><img alt="DefaultValue" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DefaultValue.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
A variable declared within a method definition is called a local variable. 定义在方法里的变量
<br>
<br>If two methods each have a local variable of the same name, they are still two entirely different variables.
<br>A local variable is only valid for calculation insideits method definition.
<br>Local variables aredestroyed automatically when the method call ends
<br><br>
<br>Define:<br>
[&lt;modifiers&gt;] &lt;return_type&gt;&lt;name&gt;([parameter_list]) {}
<br><br>
It(this) works as a reference to the current Object, whose method or constructor is being invoked.
<br><br>
<br>this must be used if a parameter or a local variable with the same name is used in a method.
<br><br>
<br>this keyword can be used inside the constructor to call another overloaded constructor in the same class.
<br>By this way, we can call the constructor explicitly.
<br>Note: thiskeyword can only be the first statement in Constructor
<br>public class Person{
    private intage;
    private String name;
    public Person(){
        this("Bob",0);
        System.out.println("Inside Constructor without parameter");
    }
    public Person(String name, intage){
        this.name = name;
        this.age= age;
        System.out.println("Inside Constructor with two parameters");
    }
}
<br><br>public class Person {
    private intage;
    private String name;
    public Person(String name, intage) 
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.age= age;
    }
    public void method1(Person pp) 
    {
        System.out.println("Inside Method1");
        System.out.println("Age:"+pp.age);
    }
    public void method2() 
    {
        this.method1(this);
        System.out.println("Inside Method2");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        Person p = new Person("Bob",23);
        p.method2();
    }
}

<br>Java Method Overloading

<br>Overloading occurs if several methods have the same name but different parameters.
<br>Overloaded methods:
<br>appear in the same class;
<br>have the same name; but
<br>have different parameter lists; and
<br>can have different return types

 <br><br><br>
<br>Some methods should not have code.
<br>So make the methods abstract: do not need to implement the methods at all. The methods have no code, only a ";".
<br>
<br>Non-private abstract methods are inherited by subclasses, just like other methods. -----&gt;非私有抽象类将其被子类继承。
<br>Abstract methods will later be overridden in subclasses using non-abstract methods, just like other methods. -----&gt;抽象化方法将在子类被重写。

<br>Example: the Circle class overrides the abstract area method inherited from the Shape class, to compute the area of a circle using Math.PI.


<br>It is possible to override an inherited abstract method with another abstract method, but it is useless since it just replaces one abstract method with another. -----&gt;可以用新的抽象方法重写，但也意味着子类仍是抽象类。
<br>A class with one or more abstract methods must itself be declared abstract. -----&gt;存在抽象方法的类是抽象类

<br>A class can even be declared as abstract even though ithas no abstract methods. -----&gt;即使没有抽象方法也可被定义成抽象类


<br>Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. -----&gt;抽象方法不可被实例化 ==&gt;不可创建新的类对象
<br>
<br>Note that you can still create object variables of an abstract class, but such a variable must refer to an object of a non abstract subclass.
<br>public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Cannot instantiate the type shape
    Shape s = new Shape(); // Forbidden
    Circle c = new Circle(); // Okay
    Shape sc = new Circle(); // Okay
    ...
    }
}
<br><br>
<br>An interface is a specification of what some classes can do (which public methods they have) without saying how the classes do it (which code the methods have) 一些共用的抽象的方法的集合

<br>In the Java programming language, an interface is not a class but a set of requirements for classes that want to conform to the interface.


<br>All methods listed in an interface are always public. 方法必须是公开的，否则没有意义
<br>An interface is specified using the interface keyword.<br>
public interface xxx {..}
<br>
<br>An interface is not a class . Interfaces never have instance fields, and the methods are never implemented in the interface.
<br>
It is not possible to create an object from an interface 因为接口是抽象方法的集合，所以可以类比抽象类，所以无法创建对象<br>
接口不是类
<br>A class specifies that it implements an interface using the implements keyword.<br>
public class xxx implements xxx {…}
<br>
<br>The class must then provide code for all the methods listed in that interface (except if the class is abstract, in which case some of the methods listed in the interface can be abstract in the class).
<br>An interface can also contain constants (static final data) but this is more rare.
<br>public interface Movable {
    public double getSpeed();

    public void setSpeed(double newSpeed);

    public static final int MY_CONSTANT = 100;
    //在上面的示例中，MY_CONSTANT是一个常量，它被声明为public static final，这意味着它是一个公共的、静态的和不可变值。
}

public class Car extends Vehicle implements Movable {
    ...
    @Override
    public double getSpeed() { ... }

    @Override
    public void setSpeed(double newSpeed) { ... }
}

public abstract class Car extends Vehicle implements Movable {
    ...
    /*
     * Does not implement setSpeed method, leave it to a
     * subclass to implement the missing method
     */
@Override
public double getSpeed() { ... }
}

public class SmallCar extends Car {
    @Override
    public void setSpeed(double newSpeed) {
        // Implement the missing method
    }
}

<br><br>
<br>Multiple unrelated classes can implement the same interface. 接口可以实现多重继承

<br>Example: a Car class and a Rabbit class both might have getSpeed and setSpeed methods to implement the Movable interface, even though the two classes are unrelated (their only common ancestor is the Object class).


<br>The same class can implement multiple unrelated interfaces.

<br>Example: a Rabbit class might implement both the Movable interface and the Edible interface.


<br>If a class implements an interface, then any subclass implicitly implements the same interface too, because the subclass inherits from its parent class all the methods necessary to implement the interface.
<br>public interface Movable {
    public double getSpeed();

    public void setSpeed(double newSpeed);
}

public interface Edible {
    public void cook();
}

public class Car extends Vehicle implements Movable {
    ...
    @Override
    public double getSpeed() { ... }

    @Override
    public void setSpeed(double newSpeed) { ... }
}

public class Rabbit extends Animal implements Movable, Edible {
    @Override
    public double getSpeed() { ... }

    @Override
    public void setSpeed(double newSpeed) { ... }

    @Override
    public void cook() { ... }
}
<br><br>
<br>Just like a class, an interface can also be used as a type.

<br>Example: the Rabbit class implements the Edible interface, therefore a rabbit object can be assigned to a variable of type Edible:


<br>Edible e = new Rabbit(); //类比子类继承父类
e.cook(); // Cooking the rabbit.
<br>
<br>This is the same subtyping polymorphism we have seen when studying class inheritance (a rabbit object can be used as an animal object if the Rabbit class is a subclass of the Animal class) but with interfaces.
<br><br>
<br>Using interfaces, you can write code that processes data without knowing what kind of data it really is.
<br>Example:
<br>public class Test {
    ...
    public void stopMovable(Movable m) {
        m.setSpeed(0.0); // m’s speed is now zero.
    }
}
<br>
<br>
The stopMovable method stops a movable object, but it does not know whether the movable object is a car or a rabbit. It only knows that the object is movable (which is really the only thing it needs to know).

<br>
An interface splits your software into two parts:

<br>The classes that implement the interface (provide code for all the methods listed in the interface).
<br>The rest of the code that uses the interface (call the methods listed in the interface).


<br>
The classes that implement the interface do not need to know anything about how the rest of the code uses the interface. 实现时不需考虑如何使用

<br>
The rest of the code that uses the interface does not need to know anything about how the classes implementing the interface work internally. 使用时不需考虑如何实现

<br><br>
<br>The interface creates a contract between the two sides:

<br>The implementation side promises to provide code for all the methods listed in the interface.
<br>The use side promises to use only the methods listed in the interface.


<br><br>
<br>Compare:

<br>Both contain no code for abstract methods.
<br>Both cannot be used to create objects.
<br>Both provide subtyping polymorphism.


<br>Contrast:

<br>The interface splits your code into two parts and works as an API between the two parts. The classes implementing the interface are unrelated to each other (Car and Rabbit), they just happen to be able to do some of the same things.
<br>The abstract class is used for code inheritance (even if all the methods are abstract and no code is actually inherited). The subclasses are closely related to each other (Student and Teacher) since they are special cases of the same parent class (Person).<br>

 <br><br><br><br>
<br>The naming of identifiers is exactly the same as in C.
<br>In Python, you don't have to declare a variable before using it.
<br>In Python, a variable is more like a reference and one variable can refer to any data type.
<br>The following assignments of variables are all valid.<br>a = 1.2
a = "Daisy"

a, b = "Hello", "World"
# a is "Hello" and b is "World"

a = b = [1,2,3]
# a and b are both [1,2,3]
<br><br>
<br>You can enclose strings using single ('), double (") or triple (''') quotes.
<br>There is no difference between single and double quotes.

<br>Python 中单引号 ' 和双引号 " 使用完全相同。


<br>Triple quotes can denote a string across multiple lines.

<br>使用三引号(''' 或 """)可以指定一个多行字符串。


<br><br>Python has a smaller set of keywords than C does.<br>
All the python keywords, as shown below, contain only lowercase letters.<br>and, exec, not, as, finally, or, assert,
for, pass, break, from, print, class, global,
raise, continue, if, return, def, import, try,
del, in, while, elif, is, with, else,
lambda, yield, except
<br><br>In Python, end of a statement is marked by a newline character (no semicolon!). But we can write a single statement over multiple lines with the line continuation character (\). For example:<br># use "\" to divide one statement over multiple lines
a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9
<br>Further, line continuation is implied inside parentheses (()), brackets ([]) and braces ({}). In the following example, the line continuation character can be omitted.<br>print("Hello",
      "World")
gender = ["female",
         "male"]
<br>If you want to put multiple statements in a single line, seperate them using semicolons (;).<br>a = 1; b = 2; c = 3
<br>Python does not use braces ({}) to indicate blocks of code. Code blocks are denoted by line indentation and this is rigidly enforced. Wrong indentation will cause error!<br>A code block starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line.<br>
Generally four whitespaces are used for indentation. In a Jupyter notebook, you may press "tab" to input four whitespaces.<br><br>Till now, we have used the print() function for output for plenty of times. For input, we have the input() function, and its syntax is:<br>input([prompt])
<br>prompt is a string which can be printed on the screen. This parameter is optional. Below is an example.<br>name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name, "is a good name :)")

<br>
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception.

<br>
An exception is a Python object that represents an error.

<br>
When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.

<br>Example 1
fileDir = ''
f = open(fileDir, 'r')
f.close()


<br>
Explanation: Since Python cannot find the file under fileDir, it will raise IOError immediately. The program will terminate and Python will quit.

<br>
Python has many built-in Exceptions. You can check <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html" target="_blank">here</a>.


<br>
<br>
In some cases, you would know that some suspicious code may raise an exception (e.g. irregular user input), you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try block, and handles the potential exceptions explicitly in except block.

<br>
This is very helpful to write strong and reliable code.

<br><br><br>try: # You do your error prone operations here;
	#statement2
	#statement3
except Exception1:
	#If there is Exception1, then execute this block.
except Exception2:
	#If there is Exception2, then execute this block.
else:
	#If there is no exception then execute this block.
<br>Workflow<br>
<br>
It works in the following way:

<br>
First all lines between try and except statements.

<br>
If ExceptionName happens during execution of the statements then except clause statements execute

<br>
If no exception happens then the statements inside except clause does not execute.

<br>
If the Exception is not handled in the except block then it goes out of try block.

<br>Attention<br>
<br>
Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax:

<br>
A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.

<br>
You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.

<br>
After the except clause(s), you can include an else clause. The code in the else block executes if the code in the try block does not raise an exception.

<br>
The else block is a good place for code that does not need the try block's protection.

<br>Example-2
fh = open('testfile.txt', 'r')
s = fh.read()
fh.close()
print(s)

try:
	fh = open('testfile.txt', 'r')
	s = fh.read()
	fh.close()
	print(s)
except FileNotFoundError:
	print ("Error: can't find file")
else:
	print ("Read succeeded!")
print ("Haha") # Always printed


Output
Error: can't find file
Haha

<br>The result depends on whether your current directory contains the testfile.txt. If exists, the file will be read and then the else statement will be executed. If not, except FileNotFoundError will be executed.<br>Example 3
def get_number():
#"Returns a float number"
	number = float(input("Enter a float number: "))
	return number
  
i = 0.0
while i != 8.0:
	try:
		i = get_number()
	except ValueError:
		print ("You entered a wrong value.")
	else:
		print ('There is no error. i is:', i)
	print ('haha') # Always printed every time around the loop
print('after loop') # Always printed

Output
Enter a float number: 8.0
There is no error. i is: 8.0
haha
after loop

<br><br>
<br>You can also use the except statement with no exceptions defined as follows
<br>try:
	#You do your operations here;
except:
	#If there has exception, then execute this block.
else:
	#If no exception then execute this block.
<br>
<br>This kind of a try-except statement catches all the exceptions that occur. Using this kind of try-except statement is not considered a good programming practice though, because it catches all exceptions but does not make the programmer identify the root cause of the problem that may occur.
<br>try:
	assert int(input('Input a value: ')) == 3
except ValueError:
	print ('Input type is not appropriate')
except:
	print ('Other errors like assertion error')  
print ('If the error is handled, then you can see this.')
<br>Output<br>Input a value: 3
If the error is handled, then you can see this.
<br><br>
<br>You can use a finally block along with a try block. The finally block is a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try block raised an exception or not. The syntax of the try-finally statement is:
<br>try:
	#You do your operations here;
except &lt;expeciton&gt;:
	#Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
finally:
	#This would always be executed.
<br>Example 4
def testFunc():
	try:
		f = open('test.txt', 'w') # Succeeds
		f.dummyFunction() # Exception here
	except AttributeError:
		print ('Exception appears happening here')
		return # no matter what, "finally" will be executed
	finally:
		print ('I am finally here')
		f.close() # We always close the file, even when doing return  
		
testFunc()

Output
Exception appears happening here
I am finally here

<br><br>
<br>
You can create your own exception by inheriting the Python built-in Exception class.

<br>
When certain condition meets, you can raise the exception object which is defined.

<br>class ShortInputException(Exception): # inherit from the "Exception" class
	'''A user-defined exception class containing two variables.'''
	def __init__(self, length, atleast):
		Exception.__init__(self)
		self.length = length
		self.atleast = atleast
	def shortInputExceptionAction(self):
		print ('shortInputException can do many operations here')
		print ('Your input length %d, but the length should be at least %d'% (self.length, self.atleast))

try:
	s = input('Enter Something: ')
	if len(s) &lt; 3:
	raise ShortInputException(len(s), 3) # create and raise (activate) your own Exception object

except KeyboardInterrupt: # When using the Kernel -&gt; Interrupt menu

print ('Why did you do interrupt me?')

except ShortInputException as x: # x is now the name for the exception object which is handled in this block

x.shortInputExceptionAction()

else:

print ('No exception was raised.')

<br>Enter Something: 3333<br>No exception was raised.<br>
<br>You can create as many exception classes as needed.
<br><br>
class ShortInputException(Exception):

'''A user-defined exception class.'''

def __init__(self, length, atleast):

Exception.__init__(self)

self.length = length

self.atleast = atleast

  

def shortInputExceptionAction(self):

print ('shortInputException can do many operations here')

print ('Your input length %d, but the length should be at least %d'% (self.length, self.atleast))

  

class LongInputException(Exception):

'''A user-defined exception class.'''

def __init__(self, length, atmost):

Exception.__init__(self)

self.length = length

self.atmost = atmost

  

def longInputExceptionAction(self):

print ('longInputExceptionAction can do many operations here')

print ('Your input length %d, but the length should be at most %d'% (self.length, self.atmost))

<br>
try:

s = input('Enter Something: ')

if len(s) &lt; 3:

raise ShortInputException(len(s), 3) # raise your own Exception object

if len(s) &gt; 7:

raise LongInputException(len(s), 7)

except KeyboardInterrupt: # When using the Kernel -&gt; Interrupt menu

print ('Why did you do interrupt me?')

except ShortInputException as x: # x is the "ShortInputException" object

x.shortInputExceptionAction()

except LongInputException as x:

x.longInputExceptionAction()

else:

print ('No exception was raised.')

<br>Enter Something: 33333<br>No exception was raised.<br><br>
<br>
The assert statement will help you check the validity of an expression. If the expression is false, Python raises an AssertionError exception.

<br>
Programmers often place assertions to check whether the input or the result obtained fulfills the expectation.

<br><br>
assert Expression[, ArgumentExpression]

<br>
<br>If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception using the try-except statement, but if not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.
<br><br>
def KelvinToFahrenheit(Temperature):

# assert Temperature &gt;= 0, "So cold, temperature below zero"

return (Temperature - 273) * 1.8 + 32

  

print (KelvinToFahrenheit(273))

<br>
if m or n are not numbers, the function should return 'Error: Not numbers';

<br>
if n is zero, the function should return 'Error: Zero divisor'.

<br>You program should not crash in any of the cases above.<br>Note: You are NOT allowed to use any if-branches!<br>
def divide(m, n):

try:

result = m / n # This can raise a ZeroDivisionError

return result

<br>Using List Create numpy array
<br># integer array:
np.array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3])
<br>Output:<br>array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3])
<br>
<br>NumPy is constrained to arrays that all contain the same type.
<br>
<br>If types do not match, NumPy will upcast if possible (here, integers are up-cast to floating point):
<br>np.array([3.14, 4, 2, 3])
<br>Output:<br>array([3.14, 4.  , 2.  , 3.  ])
<br>
<br>Explicitly set the data type of the resulting array, use the dtype keyword:
<br>np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='float32')
<br>Output:<br>array([1., 2., 3., 4.], dtype=float32)
<br>
<br>NumPy arrays can explicitly be multi-dimensional
<br># nested lists result in multi-dimensional arrays
a = np.array([range(i, i + 3) for i in [2, 4, 6]])
a
<br>Output<br>array([[2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [6, 7, 8]])
<br><br>Especially for larger arrays, it is more efficient to create arrays from scratch using routines built into NumPy.<br><br>np.zeros(&lt;createshape&gt;, dtype=&lt;datatype&gt;)
np.ones(&lt;createshape&gt;, dtype=&lt;datatype&gt;)
np.full(&lt;createshape&gt;,&lt;fill number&gt;)
<br>Example: Create a length-10 integer array filled with zeros
np.zeros(10, dtype=int)

Output
array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

<br>Example: Create a 3x5 floating-point array filled with ones
np.ones((3, 5), dtype=float)

Output
array([[1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]])

<br>Example: Create a 3x5 array filled with 3.14
np.full((3, 5), 3.14)

array([[3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14],
       [3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14],
       [3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14, 3.14]])
  

<br><br>np.arange(start, end, step) #Starting at start, ending at end, stepping by step
np.linspace(start, end, step) #Starting at start, ending at end, Divide by step
np.random.random(&lt;shape&gt;) #Uniformly distributed
np.random.normal(a, b, &lt;shape&gt;) #Construct range from a to b normally distributed matrix 
np.random.randint(a, b, &lt;shape&gt;) #random integers in the interval [0, 10)
np.eye(n) # Construct identity matrix 
<br>Example: Create an array filled with a linear sequence
# Starting at 0, ending at 20, stepping by 2
# (this is similar to the built-in range() function)
np.arange(0, 20, 2)

array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18])

<br>Example: Create an array of five values evenly spaced between 0 and 1
# Create an array of five values evenly spaced between 0 and 1
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)

	array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  ])

<br>Example: Create a 3x3 array of uniformly distributed
# random values between 0 and 1
np.random.random((3, 3))

array([[0.37598881, 0.21179029, 0.70865879],
       [0.95135829, 0.7208924 , 0.90282807],
       [0.94199024, 0.31798853, 0.96914883]])

<br>Example: Create a 3x3 array of normally distributed random values
# with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
np.random.normal(0, 1, (3, 3))

array([[-0.60396295, -1.2562087 , -0.70299877],
       [ 1.19554453,  0.16795621, -1.08435634],
       [-1.53097616, -0.88395816, -0.16151936]])

<br>Example: Create a 3x3 array of random integers in the interval [0, 10)
np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3))

array([[6, 1, 5],
       [5, 8, 9],
       [9, 6, 4]])

<br>Example: Create a 3x3 identity matrix
np.eye(3)

array([[1., 0., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 1.]])

<br>Create an uninitialized array of three integers
# The values will be whatever happens to already exist at that memory location
np.empty(3)

array([1., 1., 1.])

<br><br>
<br>NumPy arrays contain values of a single type, so it is important to have detailed knowledge of those types and their limitations.
<br>Because NumPy is built in C, the types will be familiar to users of C language.
<br>Note that when constructing an array, they can be specified using a string:<br>np.zeros(10, dtype='int16')
<br>Or using the associated NumPy object:<br>np.zeros(10, dtype=np.int16)
<br>The standard NumPy data types are listed in the following table.

<br><br>This section will present several examples of using NumPy array manipulation to access data and subarrays, and to split, reshape, and join the arrays.<br>Get to know them well!<br>We'll cover a few categories of basic array manipulations here:<br>
<br>Attributes of arrays: Determining the size, shape, memory consumption, and data types of arrays
<br>Indexing of arrays: Getting and setting the value of individual array elements
<br>Slicing of arrays: Getting and setting smaller subarrays within a larger array
<br>Reshaping of arrays: Changing the shape of a given array
<br>Joining and splitting of arrays: Combining multiple arrays into one, and splitting one array into many
<br><br>First let's discuss some useful array attributes.<br>
We'll start by defining three random arrays, a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional array.<br>
We'll use NumPy's random number generator, which we will seed with a set value in order to ensure that the same random arrays are generated each time this code is run:<br>import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)  # seed for reproducibility

x1 = np.random.randint(10, size=6)  # One-dimensional array
x2 = np.random.randint(10, size=(3, 4))  # Two-dimensional array
x3 = np.random.randint(10, size=(3, 4, 5))  # Three-dimensional array
<br>Each array has attributes ndim (the number of dimensions), shape (the size of each dimension), and size (the total size of the array):<br>print("x3 ndim: ", x3.ndim)
print("x3 shape:", x3.shape)
print("x3 size: ", x3.size)
<br>x3 ndim:  3
x3 shape: (3, 4, 5)
x3 size:  60
<br>Another useful attribute is the dtype, the data type of the array:<br>print("dtype:", x3.dtype)
<br>dtype: int64
<br>Other attributes include itemsize, which lists the size (in bytes) of each array element, and nbytes, which lists the total size (in bytes) of the array:<br>print("itemsize:", x3.itemsize, "bytes")
print("nbytes:", x3.nbytes, "bytes")
<br>itemsize: 8 bytes
nbytes: 480 bytes
<br>In general, we expect that nbytes is equal to itemsize times size.<br><br>If you are familiar with Python's standard list indexing, indexing in NumPy will feel quite familiar.<br>
In a one-dimensional array, the  value (counting from zero) can be accessed by specifying the desired index in square brackets, just as with Python lists:<br>x1
<br>array([5, 0, 3, 3, 7, 9])
<br>x1[0]
<br>5
<br>To index from the end of the array, you can use negative indices:<br>x1[-1]
<br>9
<br>In a multi-dimensional array, items can be accessed using a comma-separated tuple of indices:<br>x2
<br>array([[3, 5, 2, 4],
       [7, 6, 8, 8],
       [1, 6, 7, 7]])
<br>x2[2, 0]
<br>1
<br>x2[2, -1]
<br>7
<br>Q4: What is x2[-1, -2]?<br>Values can also be modified using any of the above index notation:<br>x2[0, 0] = 12
x2
<br>array([[12,  5,  2,  4],
       [ 7,  6,  8,  8],
       [ 1,  6,  7,  7]])
<br>Keep in mind that, unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays have a fixed type.<br>
This means, for example, that if you attempt to insert a floating-point value to an integer array, the value will be silently truncated. Don't be caught unaware by this behavior!<br>x1[0] = 3.14159  # this will be truncated!
x1
<br>array([3, 0, 3, 3, 7, 9])
<br><br>Just as we can use square brackets to access individual array elements, we can also use them to access subarrays with the slice notation, marked by the colon (:) character.<br>
The NumPy slicing syntax follows that of the standard Python list; to access a slice of an array x, use this:<br>x[start:stop:step]
<br>If any of these are unspecified, they default to the values start=0, stop=size of dimension, step=1.<br>
We'll take a look at accessing sub-arrays in one dimension and in multiple dimensions.<br><br>x = np.arange(10)
x
<br>array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
<br>x[:5]  # first five elements
<br>array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
<br>x[5:]  # elements after index 5
<br>array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
<br>x[4:7]  # middle sub-array
<br>array([4, 5, 6])
<br>x[::2]  # every other element
<br>array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
<br>x[1::2]  # every other element, starting at index 1
<br>A potentially confusing case is when the step value is negative.<br>
In this case, the array is reversed. start is the starting index of the reversed list, while stop is the stopping index<br>
This becomes a convenient way to reverse an array:<br>x[::-1]  # all elements, reversed
<br>x[5::-1]  # reversed list starting from index 5
<br>Q5: What is x-2-2?<br><br>Multi-dimensional slices work in the same way, with multiple slices separated by commas.<br>
For example:<br>x2
<br>x2[:2, :3]  # first two rows, first three columns
<br>Q5: What is x2[:4, :5]?<br>x2[:3, ::2]  # all rows, every other column
<br>Finally, subarray dimensions can even be reversed together:<br>x2[::-1, ::-1] # reverse rows and columns together
<br><br>One commonly needed routine is accessing of single rows or columns of an array.<br>
This can be done by combining indexing and slicing, using an empty slice marked by a single colon (:):<br>print(x2[:, 0])  # first column of x2
<br>x2[:,0].shape
<br>print(x2[0, :])  # first row of x2
<br>In the case of row access, the empty slice can be omitted for a more compact syntax:<br>print(x2[0])  # equivalent to x2[0, :]
<br><br>One important–and extremely useful–thing to know about array slices is that they return views rather than copies of the array data.<br>
This is one area in which NumPy array slicing differs from Python list slicing: in lists, slices will be copies.<br>
Consider our two-dimensional array from before:<br>print(x2)
<br>Let's extract a  subarray from this:<br>x2_sub = x2[:2, :2]
print(x2_sub)
<br>Now if we modify this subarray, we'll see that the original array is changed! Observe:<br>x2_sub[0, 0] = 99
print(x2_sub)
<br>print(x2)
<br>This default behavior is actually quite useful: it means that when we work with large datasets, we can access and process pieces of these datasets without the need to copy the underlying data buffer.<br><br>Despite the nice features of array views, it is sometimes useful to instead explicitly copy the data within an array or a subarray. This can be most easily done with the copy() method:<br>x2_sub_copy = x2[:2, :2].copy()
print(x2_sub_copy)
<br>If we now modify this subarray, the original array is not touched:<br>x2_sub_copy[0, 0] = 42
print(x2_sub_copy)
<br>print(x2)
<br><br>Another useful type of operation is reshaping of arrays.<br>
The most flexible way of doing this is with the reshape method.<br>
For example, if you want to put the numbers 1 through 9 in a  grid, you can do the following:<br>grid = np.arange(1, 10).reshape((3, 3))
print(grid)
<br>Note that for this to work, the size of the initial array must match the size of the reshaped array.<br>
Where possible, the reshape method will use a no-copy view of the initial array, but with non-contiguous memory buffers this is not always the case.<br>Another common reshaping pattern is the conversion of a one-dimensional array into a two-dimensional row or column matrix.<br>
This can be done with the reshape method, or more easily done by making use of the newaxis keyword within a slice operation:<br>x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
x
<br># row vector via newaxis
x[np.newaxis, :]
<br># column vector via reshape
x.reshape((3, 1))
<br>Q6: What has been changed after the reshape method?<br># column vector via newaxis
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
x[:, np.newaxis]
<br><br>All of the preceding routines worked on single arrays. It's also possible to combine multiple arrays into one, and to conversely split a single array into multiple arrays. We'll take a look at those operations here.<br><br>Concatenation, or joining of two arrays in NumPy, is primarily accomplished using the routines np.concatenate, np.vstack, and np.hstack.<br>
np.concatenate takes a tuple or list of arrays as its first argument, as we can see here:<br>x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([3, 2, 1])
np.concatenate([x, y])
<br>You can also concatenate more than two arrays at once:<br>z = [99, 99, 99]
print(np.concatenate([x, y, z]))
<br>It can also be used for two-dimensional arrays:<br>grid = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6]])
<br># concatenate along the first axis
np.concatenate([grid, grid])
<br># concatenate along the second axis (zero-indexed)
np.concatenate([grid, grid], axis=1)
<br>For working with arrays of mixed dimensions, it can be clearer to use the np.vstack (vertical stack) and np.hstack (horizontal stack) functions:<br>x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
grid = np.array([[9, 8, 7],
                 [6, 5, 4]])

# vertically stack the arrays
np.vstack([x, grid])
<br>Q7：What may happen if we use hstack function in the previous cell?<br># horizontally stack the arrays
y = np.array([[99],
              [99]])
np.hstack([grid, y])
<br>Similary, np.dstack will stack arrays along the third axis.<br><br>The opposite of concatenation is splitting, which is implemented by the functions np.split, np.hsplit, and np.vsplit.  For each of these, we can pass a list of indices giving the split points:<br>x = [1, 2, 3, 99, 99, 3, 2, 1]
x1, x2, x3 = np.split(x, [3, 5]) # split at third position and fifth position.
print(x1, x2, x3)
<br>Notice that N split-points, leads to N + 1 subarrays.<br>
The related functions np.hsplit and np.vsplit are similar:<br>grid = np.arange(16).reshape((4, 4))
grid
<br>upper, lower = np.vsplit(grid, [2])
print(upper)
print(lower)
<br>left, right = np.hsplit(grid, [2])
print(left)
print(right)
<br>Similarly, np.dsplit will split arrays along the third axis.<br><br>Computation on NumPy arrays can be very fast, or it can be very slow.<br>
The key to making it fast is to use vectorized operations, generally implemented through NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs).<br>
This section motivates the need for NumPy's ufuncs, which can be used to make repeated calculations on array elements much more efficient.<br>
It then introduces many of the most common and useful arithmetic ufuncs available in the NumPy package.<br><br>The relative slowness of Python generally manifests itself in situations where many small operations are being repeated – for instance looping over arrays to operate on each element.<br>
For example, imagine we have an array of values and we'd like to compute the reciprocal (倒数) of each.<br>
A straightforward approach might look like this:<br>import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)

def compute_reciprocals(values):
    output = np.empty(len(values))
    for i in range(len(values)):
        output[i] = 1.0 / values[i]
    return output
        
values = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=5)
compute_reciprocals(values)
<br>This implementation probably feels fairly natural to someone from, say, a C or Java background.<br>
But if we measure the execution time of this code for a large input, we see that this operation is very slow, perhaps surprisingly so!<br>
We'll benchmark this with IPython's %timeit :<br>big_array = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=1000000)
%timeit compute_reciprocals(big_array)
<br>It takes several seconds to compute these million operations and to store the result!<br>
When even cell phones have processing speeds measured in Giga-FLOPS (i.e., billions of numerical operations per second), this seems almost absurdly slow.<br>
It turns out that the bottleneck here is not the operations themselves, but the type-checking and function dispatches that CPython must do at each cycle of the loop.<br>
Each time the reciprocal is computed, Python first examines the object's type and does a dynamic lookup of the correct function to use for that type.<br>
If we were working in compiled code instead, this type specification would be known before the code executes and the result could be computed much more efficiently.<br><br>For many types of operations, NumPy provides a convenient interface into just this kind of statically typed, compiled routine. This is known as a vectorized operation.<br>
This can be accomplished by simply performing an operation on the array, which will then be applied to each element.<br>
This vectorized approach is designed to push the loop into the compiled layer that underlies NumPy, leading to much faster execution.<br>Compare the results of the following two:<br>print(compute_reciprocals(values))
print(1.0 / values)
<br>Looking at the execution time for our big array, we see that it completes orders of magnitude faster than the Python loop:<br>%timeit (1.0 / big_array)
<br>Vectorized operations in NumPy are implemented via ufuncs, whose main purpose is to quickly execute repeated operations on values in NumPy arrays.<br>
Ufuncs are extremely flexible – before we saw an operation between a scalar and an array, but we can also operate between two arrays:<br>np.arange(5)
<br>np.arange(5) / np.arange(1, 6)
<br>And ufunc operations are not limited to one-dimensional arrays–they can also act on multi-dimensional arrays as well:<br>x = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
2 ** x
<br>Computations using vectorization through ufuncs are nearly always more efficient than their counterpart implemented using Python loops, especially as the arrays grow in size.<br>
Any time you see such a loop in a Python script, you should consider whether it can be replaced with a vectorized expression.<br><br>Ufuncs exist in two flavors: unary ufuncs, which operate on a single input, and binary ufuncs, which operate on two inputs.<br>
We'll see examples of both these types of functions here.<br><br>NumPy's ufuncs feel very natural to use because they make use of Python's native arithmetic operators.<br>
The standard addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can all be used:<br>x = np.arange(4)
print("x     =", x)
print("x + 5 =", x + 5)
print("x - 5 =", x - 5)
print("x * 2 =", x * 2)
print("x / 2 =", x / 2)
print("x // 2 =", x // 2)  # floor division
<br>There is also a unary ufunc for negation, and a ** operator for exponentiation, and a % operator for modulus:<br>print("-x     = ", -x)
print("x ** 2 = ", x ** 2)
print("x % 2  = ", x % 2)
<br>In addition, these can be strung together however you wish, and the standard order of operations is respected:<br>-(0.5*x + 1) ** 2
<br>Each of these arithmetic operations are simply convenient wrappers around specific functions built into NumPy; for example, the + operator is a wrapper for the add function:<br>np.add(x, 2)
<br>The following table lists the arithmetic operators implemented in NumPy:<br><br><br>Just as NumPy understands Python's built-in arithmetic operators, it also understands Python's built-in absolute value function:<br>x = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])
abs(x)
<br>The corresponding NumPy ufunc is np.absolute, which is also available under the alias np.abs:<br>np.absolute(x)
<br>np.abs(x)
<br>This ufunc can also handle complex data, in which the absolute value returns the magnitude:<br>x = np.array([3 - 4j, 4 - 3j, 2 + 0j, 0 + 1j])
np.abs(x)
<br><br>NumPy provides a large number of useful ufuncs, and some of the most useful for the data scientist are the trigonometric functions.<br>
We'll start by defining an array of angles:<br>Q8: What is the Chinese of Trigonometric functions?<br>theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 3)
print(theta)
<br>Now we can compute some trigonometric functions on these values:<br>print("theta      = ", theta)
print("sin(theta) = ", np.sin(theta))
print("cos(theta) = ", np.cos(theta))
print("tan(theta) = ", np.tan(theta))
<br>The values are computed to within machine precision, which is why values that should be zero do not always hit exactly zero.<br>
Inverse trigonometric functions are also available:<br>x = [-1, 0, 1]
print("x         = ", x)
print("arcsin(x) = ", np.arcsin(x))
print("arccos(x) = ", np.arccos(x))
print("arctan(x) = ", np.arctan(x))
<br><br>Another common type of operation available in a NumPy ufunc are the exponentials:<br>x = [1, 2, 3]
print("x     =", x)
print("e^x   =", np.exp(x))
print("2^x   =", np.exp2(x))
print("3^x   =", np.power(3, x))
<br>The inverse of the exponentials, the logarithms, are also available.<br>
The basic np.log gives the natural logarithm; if you prefer to compute the base-2 logarithm or the base-10 logarithm, these are available as well:<br>x = [1, 2, 4, 10]
print("x        =", x)
print("ln(x)    =", np.log(x))
print("log2(x)  =", np.log2(x))
print("log10(x) =", np.log10(x))
<br>There are also some specialized versions that are useful for maintaining precision with very small input:<br>x = [0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
print("exp(x) - 1 =", np.expm1(x))
print("log(1 + x) =", np.log1p(x))
<br>When x is very small, these functions give more precise values than if the raw np.log or np.exp were to be used.<br>There are many, many more ufuncs available in both NumPy and scipy.special.<br>
Because the documentation of these packages is available online, a web search along the lines of "gamma function python" will generally find the relevant information.]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/program/python/numpy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Program/Python/Numpy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[datetime]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Create datetime object for time parsing, formatting, and arithmetic.
<br>The resources come from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://pymotw.com/3/datetime/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://pymotw.com/3/datetime/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The datetime module provides a number of ways to deal with dates, times, and time intervals.

<br>
The datetime module contains the following types:

<br>datetime type:  represents a date and a time during that day.
<br>date type: represents just a date, between year 1 and 9999 (see below for more about the calendar used by the datetime module)
<br>time type: represents a time, independent of the datetime.date 
<br>timedelta type: represents the difference between two time or date objects.


<br><br>
<br>objects of the datetime type represent a date and a time in some timezone, which has 7 attributes 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'microsecond' as a tuple.
<br>You can construct the datetime.datetime object by the tuple, or retrive the tuple by datetime.datetime object.
<br><br>import datetime
d = datetime.datetime.now()
print (d.year)
print (d.month)
print (d.day)
print (d.hour)
print (d.minute)
print (d.second)
print (d.microsecond)

<br>print (time.time())
dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(time.time())
<br>
<br>From time string
<br>str_time = '2017-08-02 18:14:26'

for attr in [ 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'microsecond']:
    print(attr, ':', getattr(dt, attr))

construct object from y-m-d, h-m-s-m attributes
year : 2003
month : 8
day : 4
hour : 12
minute : 30
second : 45
microsecond : 0

<br>Example 3: Build object from current system time in ticks
import time
time.time?

time.time()

1713166214.4785035

time.time()/(3600*24*365.25)

54.286961444911746

print ('build object from current system time in ticks')
print (time.time())
dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(time.time())
for attr in [ 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'microsecond']:
    print (attr, ':', getattr(dt, attr))

1713166214.5121484
year : 2024
month : 4
day : 15
hour : 15
minute : 30
second : 14
microsecond : 512215

<br>Example 4: Build datetime object from time string
import datetime
str_time = '2017-08-02 18:14:26'
form = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
print ('original time is: %s, time format is: %s'%(str_time, form))
# transform the date string to datetime object
dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(str_time, form) 
print ('now we successfully obtain the datetime object')

for attr in [ 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'microsecond']:
    print (attr, ':', getattr(dt, attr))

another_form = '%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S'
print ('express the date-time in a new form:')

# transform the datetime object to date string
dt_new_format = dt.strftime(another_form)
print (dt_new_format)

original time is: 2017-08-02 18:14:26, time format is: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
now we successfully obtain the datetime object
year : 2017
month : 8
day : 2
hour : 18
minute : 14
second : 26
microsecond : 0
express the date-time in a new form:
2017-08-02 18-14-26

<br><br><br>
<br>The date type represents the date portions of a datetime object. It has attributes for year, month, and day.
<br>import datetime

# build "date" object by year-month-day triple
d = datetime.date(2017, 8, 2)
print ('year: %d, month: %d, day: %d'% (d.year, d.month, d.day))
print (d.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
<br>year: 2017, month: 8, day: 2
2017-08-02
<br><br>import datetime

t = datetime.time(18, 54, 32)
print (t)
print (t.hour, t.minute, t.second, t.microsecond)
<br>18:54:32
18 54 32 0
<br><br>
<br>The datetime type provides method to extract date and time objects, as well as a class method that combines two objects into a single datetime object:
<br>import datetime
# generate a datetime.datetime object
dt = datetime.datetime.now()
date = dt.date()
print (type(date))
time = dt.time()
print (type(time))
dt1 = datetime.datetime.combine(date, time)
print (dt == dt1)
<br>&lt;class 'datetime.date'&gt;
&lt;class 'datetime.time'&gt;
True
<br>day = datetime.date(2017, 8, 2)
time = datetime.time(18, 54, 32)
dt = datetime.datetime.combine(day, time)
print (dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S'))
<br>2017-08-02 18-54-32
<br><br><br>
<br>In somecases, you may need to add/minus a period of time on a datetime. For example, if you are asked to add 5 days, 7 hours, 36 minutes, 10 microseconds to the datetime "2017-08-02 17:29:12:34", what is the result?
<br>The datetime.timedelta object will help you perform such operation.
<br>import datetime
# you can build a datetime.timedelta object (set up a period 
# of time) by 7-elements tuple.
print ("microseconds:", datetime.timedelta(microseconds=1))
print ("milliseconds:", datetime.timedelta(milliseconds=1))
print ("seconds     :", datetime.timedelta(seconds=1))
print ("minutes     :", datetime.timedelta(minutes=1))
print ("hours       :", datetime.timedelta(hours=1))
print ("days        :", datetime.timedelta(days=1))
print ("weeks       :", datetime.timedelta(weeks=1))
<br>microseconds: 0:00:00.000001
milliseconds: 0:00:00.001000
seconds     : 0:00:01
minutes     : 0:01:00
hours       : 1:00:00
days        : 1 day, 0:00:00
weeks       : 7 days, 0:00:00
<br># this example will solve the above datetime arithmetic problem
import datetime

dt = datetime.datetime(2017,8,2,17,29,12,34)
print ('original time: ', dt)
# we use td to represent the period of time we want to add
td = datetime.timedelta(weeks=0, days=5, hours=7, minutes=36, microseconds=10)
# this will be td time later w.r.t the original time dt
datetime_future = dt + td
# this will be td time earlier w.r.t the original time dt
datetime_past = dt - td
print ('after adding some time: ', datetime_future)
print ('after minus some time: ', datetime_past)
<br>original time:  2017-08-02 17:29:12.000034
after adding some time:  2017-08-08 01:05:12.000044
after minus some time:  2017-07-28 09:53:12.000024
<br><br>
<br>Both date and time values can be compared using the standard operators to determine which is earlier or later.
<br>import datetime

print ('Times:')
t1 = datetime.time(12, 55, 0)
print ('\tt1:', t1)
t2 = datetime.time(13, 5, 0)
print ('\tt2:', t2)
print ('\tt1 &lt; t2:', t1 &lt; t2)

print ('Dates:')
d1 = datetime.date.today()
print ('\td1:', d1)
d2 = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
print ('\td2:', d2)
print ('\td1 &gt; d2:', d1 &gt; d2)
<br>Times:
 t1: 12:55:00
 t2: 13:05:00
 t1 &lt; t2: True
Dates:
 d1: 2024-04-15
 d2: 2024-04-16
 d1 &gt; d2: False
<br>Task 1: Complete the function last_week which accepts a string s representing a date and returns another string representing its previous week. Note that the format of s is mm/dd/yyyy and the returned string of the funtion should use the same format, too. You can assume that the input is always valid.<br>Hint: the methods you may need in this question are: strptime(), timedelta(), strftime().<br>import datetime
def last_week(s):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    form = '%m/%d/%Y'
    d1=datetime.datetime.strptime(s, form) 
    d2 = d1-datetime.timedelta(weeks=1)
    d2 = d2.strftime(form)
    return d2

<br>assert last_week('01/01/2024') == '12/25/2023'
assert last_week('03/07/2020') == '02/29/2020'

<br># This cell contains hidden tests, do NOT delete!
<br>Task 2: Complete the function days which accepts two strings, start and end, representing two dates for format yyyy-mm-dd. It returns the number of days between the start date and the end date, both end inclusive. Note that days should return 0 if the start date is later than the end date.<br>For example,<br>
<br>days('1980-08-28', '1980-08-29') should return 2
<br>days('1980-08-28', '1980-08-30') should return 3

<br>days('1980-08-29', '1980-08-29') should return 1
<br>days('1980-08-30', '1980-08-29') should return 0
<br>You can assume that the input is always valid.<br>import datetime
def days(start, end):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    form = '%Y-%m-%d'
    start_date=datetime.datetime.strptime(start, form) 
    end_date=datetime.datetime.strptime(end, form) 
#     print(start_date,end_date)
    if(start_date&gt;end_date):
        return 0
    else:
        delta = end_date - start_date
        return delta.days + 1  # 包含结束日期，如果只需要差距可以去掉 +1
#     raise NotImplementedError()
# print(days('1980-08-28', '1980-08-29'))
<br>assert days('1980-08-28', '1980-08-29') == 2
assert days('1980-08-28', '1980-08-30') == 3

<br>output<br>[1] 10
<br>Outer_func &lt;- function(x) {
  Inner_func &lt;- function(y) {
    a &lt;- x + y
    return(a)
  }
  return (Inner_func)
}
output &lt;- Outer_func(3) # To call the Outer_func
output(5)
<br>Example Explained<br>
You cannot directly call the function because the Inner_func has been defined (nested) inside the Outer_func.<br>We need to call Outer_func first in order to call Inner_func as a second step.<br>We need to create a new variable called output and give it a value, which is 3 here.<br>We then print the output with the desired value of "y", which in this case is 5.<br>The output is therefore 8 (3 + 5).<br><br>tri_recursion &lt;- function(k) {

<br>History: Ability to view view all package information.
<br>Here is a basic feature about the pick and send parcel.<br><img alt="Pick-Send Process" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Project/DBM/process.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>CustomerA delivers the package to courier stationA and fills in the address that needs to be delivered, then the manager of courier stationA checks the package and transfers it to courier stationB according to the address, and the manager of courier stationB accepts the package. Finally, CustomerB can pick up the package.<br><br>In the user part, the user uses uID to login, we use the ISA relationship to distinguish the user as customer, delivery manager and administrator, and this ISA relationship is not disjoint, which means that all users registered in the system can be more than one identity.<br><img alt="ER-user" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Project/DBM/user.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
In the parcel section. Each parcel will be sent and picked up by one customer, each customer can send or pick up more than one parcel at the same time, and each parcel has its responsible delivery manager, and corresponding logistic company.<br><img alt="ER-parcel" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Project/DBM/parcel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>In the courier station section, we can see that each delivery manager belongs to a courier station, and the administrator of the system can control multiple courier stations. Every courier station has a specific location for the logistics company to transport the parcel to the fixed address.<br><img alt="ER-courier_station" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Project/DBM/courier_station.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Finall we can get the ER diagram like this.<br><img alt="E-R" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Project/DBM/E-R.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>In our user requirement the 3 different kinds of users should be disjoint and total participation.<br>For the Entity part<br>we can get 3 relationship sets about the user according to the method in logical design.<br>
<br>
<br>(courier_adminstrator)
<br>(adminstrator)
<br>And for each entity we can get one relationship set<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>For the relationship part, we have 8 relationship in our system.<br>
<br>  
<br>  
<br>  
<br>  
<br> 
<br> 
<br>For above case we could not to create table.<br>
<br> 
<br> 
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><br>After the logical design the schemas in our database have already satisfed 1NF<br>Now let's continue to normalize the schema.<br>For these 3 user tables they have similar attributes<br><br>
<br>
<br>We can get the following function dependency.<br><br><br><br> is obviously candicate key it can hold the whole schema.<br>
While  and  can hold the attribute , respectively.<br>but email and phone are not superkey, therefore it violates BCNF.<br>so we do this decomposition to this schema.<br>Decomposition<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br>This obviously satisfies the BCNF.<br>For the Courier station schema it also has email and phone attribute, and there is one more property csaddress<br><br>
Functional dependency:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Therefore, we do decomposite just like before<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The next schema is about the parcel.<br><br>We can get the following function dependency like this.<br><br>We can find it only has one functional dependency. And obviously, the parcelID is the condicate key in this schema. So it has been already satisfied BCNF.<br><br>For the rest of the schema we can find it only has 2 attributes. So it must satisfy BCNF.<br><br>
<br>
<br><br><br>In this project, foreign keys are used in almost all the tables to establish connections.<br><br>In the table for each user, I used BLOB to save the profile picture。<br><img alt="BLOB" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Project/DBM/BLOB.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>When dealing with the weight and volume of the package, I checked them on the front and back ends, especially on the back end, where I used triggers to make the volume and weight range from 0-300.<br><img alt="triggers" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Project/DBM/triggers.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>
Customers can effortlessly pick and send packages, track deliveries in real-time, manage personal information, view order history, and evaluate the quality of service.<br>
Our system offers a range of dynamic shipping options to suit different customer preferences.

<br>
For courier station managers, features such as status updates, site information management, and access to comprehensive historical logs can effectively manage packages. The ability to transfer parcels between sites ensures a smooth flow of parcels through the logistics network.

<br>
In addition, administrators benefit from a centralized view of workstation status and a complete package history, allowing them to monitor and optimize overall system performance.

<br><br>
<br>customer: 200000 records.
<br>courier admin: 50000 records.
<br>admin: 500   records. (There's no need to have 10,000 administrators)
<br>parcel：15000 records.
<br>courier station：5000  records. (There are only about 5,000 in the whole country)
<br>email and phone table are the same size as its main(customer,  courier admin,  admin) table

 <br><br>A chat application allows users to interact or communicate by texting, audio, and video. It can be useful for social or commercial activities.<br>In this assignment, students are required to write a Chat Program based on Windows Socket Programming C++.<br>
The program should allow users to chat concurrently on the Internet (i.e., User A can send encrypted messages to User B, and vice versa).<br>
You can download the sample programs (namely, “server.cpp” and “client.cpp”) from the Web site. The program should consist of the following modules:<br>
<br>User management: provide functions to add, delete, or group users;
<br>Group chat: allow users to chat as a group;
<br>Management of connections: support at least three concurrent connections.
<br>User Management:  Implemented By Server<br>
<br>Server: Store the User Information
<br>Group chat: Group started by Client<br>
<br>Server Provide all users for Client User to select. 
<br>Management of connections: Give every User a Threads<br>Content Chinese version
起初，我们的客户端实现仅采用了单线程方式，消息的接收和发送是交替进行的。这种实现方式存在一个显著的问题：客户端无法同时进行消息的接收和发送操作，而是只能在完成接收后进行发送，反之亦然。这导致了客户端在等待接收或发送消息时会发生阻塞，影响用户体验。
为了克服这一问题，我们引入了多线程技术。在客户端中，我们分别为消息的接收和发送操作创建了独立的线程，从而实现了这两项操作的并发处理。这一改进使得客户端可以同时进行消息的接收和发送，提高了响应速度和用户体验。
在服务器端，我们引入了互斥锁（mutex）来确保数据传输的正确性和线程安全性。当多个用户向同一个用户发送消息时，服务器会将这些消息推送到该用户的消息队列中，并在这一过程中使用互斥锁来保证消息的有序和完整传输。这样，服务器能够在多用户环境下稳定、高效地管理消息队列，确保每个用户都能正确收到发送给他们的消息。
<br><br> I'm going to talk some details  about how we implemented this chat room application.<br><br><img alt="DataStructure" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DCN/Project-DataStructure.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>Sock: Client socket
<br>messageQueue: Queue to store messages to be sent
<br>queueMutex: Mutex to protect the message queue 
<br>queueCond: Condition variable to notify the send thread
<br><br><br><img alt="ServerThreads" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DCN/Project/ServerThreads.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>Initially, our client was single-threaded, handling message receiving and sending alternately. 
<br>This caused a problem: the client or server couldn't receive and send messages concurrently, leading to blocking and a poor user experience.
<br>To solve this, we introduced multithreading.<br>
Separate threads for receiving and sending to improve responsiveness and user experience.<br><br><br><img alt="Send" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DCN/Project/SendMessage.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>On the server side, we introduced a mutex to ensure data transmission accuracy and thread safety. 
<br>When multiple users send messages to the same user, the server pushes these messages into the receiver's message queue using a mutex to lock the process. 
<br>This ensures orderly and complete message transmission.
<br>These changes enabled the server to efficiently manage message queues in a multi-user environment, ensuring each user correctly receives their messages.<br>]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/projects/dcn/chat-application.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Projects/DCN/Chat-Application.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DCN/Project-DataStructure.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DCN/Project-DataStructure.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[System-Design-Specification]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Usage Scenario II


<br>DIAGRAMS
<br><br>Design Overview for the Data Analysis Platform<br>Our platform is meticulously architected to provide an end-to-end data analysis solution, encompassing data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization functionalities. To ensure a robust and responsive user experience, our system architecture distinctly separates the frontend and backend services.<br>Backend Architecture: We leverage the power of Python's FastAPI framework, renowned for its high performance and ease of use, to handle data-intensive backend operations efficiently. This choice enables us to implement asynchronous processing, significantly boosting the responsiveness of our platform.<br>Frontend Design: The user interface is built using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework known for its adaptability and component-based architecture. This setup allows for a dynamic and seamless interaction with the data analysis functionalities, providing users with an intuitive experience as they upload and manipulate their data.<br>Core Functionalities:<br>
<br>Data Upload: Users can easily upload datasets via the frontend interface.
<br>Data Preprocessing: The platform offers a suite of tools for cleaning and preparing data for analysis, ensuring data quality and readiness.
<br>Modeling Capabilities: Users have access to a variety of built-in models, including regression and clustering, to uncover patterns and derive insights from their data.
<br>Visualization Tools: Integrated visualization tools enable users to create engaging and informative visual representations of their analysis results.
<br>Our platform is designed to be flexible, catering to a wide range of data analysis needs and making sophisticated data science accessible to users with varying levels of expertise.<br>Here， we show some models instruction<br>Linear regression is a basic statistical model, which is used to explore the linear relationship between variables. It assumes that there is a straight line relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable, and predicts by fitting the best straight line. The fitting of the model is completed by the least square method, and the indexes such as the square of R, the square of adjusted R and the standard error are usually used in the evaluation. In application, we need to pay attention to model assumptions, such as linear relationship, multicollinearity and normal distribution of error terms.<br>Decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.<br>
A decision tree starts with a root node, which does not have any incoming branches. The outgoing branches from the root node then feed into the internal nodes, also known as decision nodes. Based on the available features, both node types conduct evaluations to form homogenous subsets, which are denoted by leaf nodes, or terminal nodes. The leaf nodes represent all the possible outcomes within the dataset.<br>K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is an instance-based supervised learning algorithm, and it is sensitive to data size and dimension. It performs classification or regression by measuring the distance between a new sample and a known sample in the training set. In classification, it assigns the new sample to the category to which the K closest neighbors belong. In regression, it predicts the value of the new sample, estimated by the average of the K closest neighbors. The working principle of the KNN algorithm consists of the following steps: Calculate distance, Select Nearest neighbor, Voting or calculating the mean.<br>设计总览

<br><br>Firstly,We have implemented an automated movie review scraper to quickly obtain a large volume of movie reviews and ratings data. Based on this dataset (over 50,000 entries), we trained and implemented two favorability rate analysis models: one based on a favorability rate dictionary and Naive Bayes (machine learning), and another retrained on a transformer with whole word masking pre-training. Additionally, we developed a scraper capable of dynamically obtaining Bilibili video information (comments, bullet chats, etc.). Finally, we integrated these features using FastAPI to achieve front-end and back-end separation, supporting dynamic retrieval of Bilibili-related information and favorability rate analysis of comments on specified Bilibili videos using the two trained models, with dynamic data presentation to the front end.<br><br>

<br><br><br>
<br>Douban: A prominent movie site where users freely express their opinions on movies. These comments are often labeled by users' favorability rates, making them invaluable for our analysis.
<br>Maoyan: Another key player in the movie industry with a rich database of user comments, similarly labeled, allowing for comparative studies and robust model training.
<br><br>To quickly acquire a large dataset, we wrote an automated crawler for movie reviews to simplify the task. It can automatically scrape movie reviews and rating information from Douban and Maoyan.<br>Additionally, we have also open-sourced this crawler on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/open17/movie-comment-spider" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/open17/movie-comment-spider" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br><br>
<br>Labeled Data: We chose to focus on comments from Douban and Maoyan because they offer labeled datasets. This is critical as labeled data provides a foundation for training and evaluating our favorability rate analysis models with higher accuracy.

<br>Maoyan: Collect comments from the Maoyan movie site.


<br>Data Cleaning

<br>Perform data cleaning to ensure the quality and consistency of the collected comments.




<br>
Model Training

<br>Machine Learning Model

<br>Utilize SnowNLP for sentiment analysis and other natural language processing tasks.


<br>Deep Learning Model

<br>Employ PaddleNLP to build and train deep learning models for advanced text analysis.




<br>
Model Application

<br>Crawling Data from Bilibili

<br>Implement real-time data crawling from Bilibili, allowing users to input a video url and retrieve video information and comments instantly.


<br>Backend Development

<br>Develop the backend using the FastAPI Python framework to handle data processing and model integration.


<br>Frontend Development

<br>Implement a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with the analysis results.




<br><br><br>Sources of Our Data<br>
<br>Douban: A prominent movie site where users freely express their opinions on movies. These comments are often labeled by users' sentiments, making them invaluable for our analysis.
<br>Maoyan: Another key player in the movie industry with a rich database of user comments, similarly labeled, allowing for comparative studies and robust model training.
<br>Why These Datasets?<br>
<br>Labeled Data: We chose to focus on comments from Douban and Maoyan because they offer labeled datasets. This is critical as labeled data provides a foundation for training and evaluating our sentiment analysis models with higher accuracy.

<br>
<br>Comment Score Example
<br><br>It turns out that the model does not work well in practice<br><br><br>
<br>With the development of deep learning, the number of model parameters has increased rapidly, and in order to train these parameters, larger data sets are needed to avoid overfitting.
<br>Nowadays, &nbsp;studies have shown that Pretrained Models (PTM) based on large-scale unlabeled corpora can acquire generic language representations and perform well when fine-tuned to downstream tasks.
<br>In addition, pre-training models can avoid training models from scratch.
<br><img alt="Contex2Vec" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/Img/contex2vec.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>BERT requires minimal architecture changes for a wide range of natural language processing applications.
<br><br>
<br>Remove a batch data from the dataloader
<br>Feed batch data to the model for forward calculation
<br>Pass forward calculation result to loss function to calculate loss. The forward calculation result is passed to the evaluation method, and the evaluation index is calculated.
<br>Loss reverse return and update gradient. Repeat the above steps.
<br>Each time an epoch is trained, the program will evaluate the effectiveness of the current model training.<br><br><br><br>

 <br><br><br><br>
<br>Ploidy traditionally has been investigated by measuring DNA content using flow cytometry
<br>It can also be inferred from next generation sequencing (NGS) data either by examining k-mer distributions, or by assessing the distribution of allele frequencies at biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
<br><br><br>
<br>Disadvantage:

<br>does not provide summary statistics that permit quantifying how well the data fit the expected distributions
<br>this approach is that it is preceded by the identification of variable sites (“SNP calling”), which is carried out using methodologies that benefit from a previously known ploidy level


<br>This method was primarily developed for resequencing studies
<br><br><br>It models base frequencies as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and uses maximum likelihood to assess empirical data under the assumptions of diploidy, triploidy and tetraploidy.<br>使用高斯混合模型对可变位点的基频分布进行建模并使用最大似然法来选择最合理的倍性模型<br><br><br><br><br><br>latent variables  .<br><br><br><br><br><br>The log-likelihood is calculated after the M-step, and the next E-step is initiated unless the log-likelihood has changed by less then  from the previous M-step.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/research/bioinfo/ploidy/ploidy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Research/BioInfo/Ploidy/Ploidy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AlphaFold2]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:ReadPaper" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#ReadPaper</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:DeepLearning" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#DeepLearning</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:Bioinfo" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#Bioinfo</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:ProteinStructurePrediction" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#ProteinStructurePrediction</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:AlphaFold2" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#AlphaFold2</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:Transformer" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#Transformer</a>

 <br><br>During this summer course, in the Reading Paper phase, our group was assigned the paper "Chain-of-Thought reasoning without prompting". After reading this paper, I developed an interest in the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach. Therefore, in my Individual Report, I would like to further explore and summarize the literature related to Chain of Thought.<br><br>Chain of Thought is a series of short sentences that mimic the reasoning process a person might go through when answering a question. CoT Promoting is a method that provides a series of prompts to guide the model through a series of thoughts. In my view, CoT Promoting offers a paradigm for thinking when answering questions—similar to the steps we take when solving problems—except here, the process of thinking is handed over to the model to generate answers.<br>Compared to Zero Shot learning, CoT Promoting has several advantages:<br>
<br>First, CoT provides explainability. When we receive an answer, we not only get the solution but also understand how it was derived.
<br>Secondly, CoT breaks down complex problems into simpler steps, enhancing the accuracy of the answers.
<br>Experiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.<br><img style="zoom:50%;" alt="Chain-of-Thought Result" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407252346079.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>PaLM 540B uses chain-of-thought prompting to achieve new state of-the-art performance on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems.<br><br>Through reviewing relevant literature, I believe there are two main methods to elicit the Chain of Thought: one is through prompting, and the other is by changing the decoding approach.<br><br>Let's first look at how to elicit Chain of Thought through prompting. After reviewing the literature, I have identified several approaches. Here, I will mainly introduce two methods: Auto-CoT and Active Prompting.<br><br>CoT prompting can be divided into two major paradigms. The first paradigm, known as Zero-Shot-CoT, involves adding a simple prompt such as "Let's think step by step" following the test question to facilitate reasoning chains in Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach does not require input-output demonstrations and is task-agnostic. The second paradigm, Manual-CoT, relies on manually designed demonstrations. Each demonstration includes a question followed by a reasoning chain that leads to the answer. Although Manual-CoT has demonstrated superior performance, it requires significant manual effort to design task-specific demonstrations.<br><img alt="Zero Shot CoT and Manual CoT" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407251741501.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>However, manually designing CoT prompting requires a significant amount of manpower and is not suitable for all tasks. Therefore, the authors have proposed Auto CoT, an automated method for designing CoT prompting. Briefly, Auto-CoT consists of two main steps:<br>
<br>Partition questions of a given dataset into eight clusters** — sentence-BERT is used to encode the questions, and then clusters are formed based on cosine similarity.
<br>Select a representative question from each cluster and generate its reasoning chain using Zero-Shot-CoT with simple heuristics — the heuristics involve not selecting a question with more than 60 tokens or a rationale with more than five reasoning steps. These heuristics aim to improve the likelihood of the auto-generated response being correct.
<br><img alt="Auto CoT" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407251729807.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>In fact, the authors initially attempted to generate a series of reasoning explanations using the Zero-Shot-CoT approach. However, they found that this simple method could not effectively replace the benefits brought by manual design, as errors often occurred in the reasoning chains generated by Zero-Shot-CoT.<br>Further analysis revealed that the diversity of problems in the reasoning explanations is crucial for mitigating the errors caused by Zero-Shot-CoT.<br>This is also why the article emphasizes the approach of "Let's think not just step by step, but also one by one."<br><br>In this method, the focus is on how to select prompts for Chain of Thought (CoT). Simply put, it's similar to how during an exam, we identify the questions that confuse us the most and prioritize learning them, rather than randomly choosing questions to study. This approach helps achieve better results.<br>The authors employed four uncertainty metrics—disagreement, entropy, variance, and confidence, with disagreement and entropy being the main metrics used in their experiments.<br>Subsequently, the questions identified as the most uncertain based on these metrics are selected for manual annotation.<br>These 'n' uncertain questions are annotated by human annotators to generate CoT rationales and then used as examples for few-shot prompting along with the test question to generate responses.<br><img alt="Active Promoting" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407251635179.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Overall, the approach of Auto CoT is based on diversity. It involves partitioning questions into clusters and generating reasoning chains for representative questions from each cluster. This method utilizes sentence embeddings and cosine similarity to ensure a wide coverage of different types of problems within a dataset, aiming to generate a broad spectrum of reasoning paths that enhance the model's ability to tackle diverse challenges.<br>On the other hand, Active Prompting is based on uncertainty. It prioritizes the selection of prompts by identifying questions with high levels of uncertainty, using metrics like disagreement and entropy. These uncertain questions are then manually annotated to create detailed CoT rationales. This approach ensures that the model is trained on the most challenging aspects of a dataset, which may require nuanced reasoning or exhibit higher error rates in automated reasoning processes.<br>Both methods aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models by guiding them in how to think through problems, but they approach the task from different angles—Auto CoT through the lens of problem diversity, and Active Prompting through the lens of targeting uncertainty.<br><br>The traditional decoding method is greedy decoding. Greedy decoding is a simple method for generating sequences where, at each step, the word with the highest probability is selected as the output, until an end symbol is generated or a predetermined output length is reached. The advantages of greedy decoding are its simplicity and speed, as it only requires selecting the highest probability word at each step. However, this method has a significant drawback: it may miss the globally optimal sequence. Since it selects only the locally optimal word at each step, greedy decoding can lead to lower quality text generation, lacking in coherence and diversity.<br><br><img alt="Self Consistency Decoding" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407260033779.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Self-Consistency Decoding essentially aggregates the answers by selecting the most frequently occurring result as the answer. First, a set of candidate outputs is sampled from the language model's decoder, generating a group of different candidate reasoning paths. Then, the answers are aggregated by marginalizing the sampled reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer from the generated results.<br><img alt="Self Consistency Decoding" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407260054056.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Self-consistency significantly enhances arithmetic reasoning performance across all four language models, surpassing the results achieved with chain-of-thought prompting. This approach yields substantial gains across the models and has achieved state-of-the-art results on five out of six tasks.<br><br>CoT-Decoding builds upon Self-Consistency by introducing a confidence metric. This method calculates the confidence level for each reasoning path and aggregates paths that lead to the same answer, ultimately selecting the path with the highest confidence as the final reasoning path. The concept mirrors the elimination method used in multiple-choice tests, where incorrect options are first excluded to identify the most probable answer from the remaining choices.<br><img alt="CoT-Decoding" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407080251459.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>This approach is particularly effective when there is a significant difference between the options. When options are closely matched, decision-making becomes challenging, and the accuracy of decisions decreases—akin to scenarios in decoding where the probability differences between tokens are minimal. In contrast, when the disparity between answer options is marked, decision-making confidence increases, similar to when there is a significant difference in token probabilities during decoding. CoT-Decoding enhances confidence assessment by accumulating the difference in probabilities between the top-2 predicted tokens.<br><img alt="Result" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407062132592.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>In the final part of the study, the authors compared various sampling and decoding methods in their experiments. The results indicate that CoT-Decoding achieved the best performance across all tasks, demonstrating that CoT-Decoding is an effective decoding method that can enhance the performance of models.	<br><br>This report has explored the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, focusing on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models through diverse prompting and decoding strategies. Auto CoT and Active Prompting refine how models generate and improve answers by harnessing problem diversity and addressing uncertainty, respectively. Meanwhile, decoding techniques like Self-Consistency Decoding and CoT Decoding improve answer accuracy and confidence by emphasizing the most consistent and probable outcomes. <br><br>Diao, S., Wang, P., Lin, Y., Pan, R., Liu, X., &amp; Zhang, T.

这篇文章通过优化解码方法，提出了CoT-Decoding， 提高回答的准确性
<br>CoT-Decoding  类似做选择题时的排除法<br>
<br>当解题人认为选项之间差距不大的时候，难以决策，或者说决策的准确性会下降

<br>对应到解码就是，不同 token 的概率差距不大的时候


<br>而当解题人认为选项答案差距较大时，决策的准确性会提高

<br>对应到解码就是，不同 token 的概率差距较大的时候


<br><br>传统的解码方法是 Greedy decoding<br>贪婪解码（Greedy Decoding）是一种简单的序列生成方法，通常用于自然语言处理中的文本生成任务。在这种方法中，每一步都选择具有最高概率的下一个词作为输出，直到生成结束符或达到预定的输出长度。<br>具体过程如下：<br>
<br>从模型生成的概率分布中选择概率最高的词作为当前步的输出。
<br>将这个词作为输入，继续生成下一个词。
<br>重复上述步骤，直到生成完整的序列。
<br>贪婪解码的优点是实现简单，速度快，因为它只需在每一步选择一个最高概率的词。然而，这种方法有一个明显的缺点，即它可能会错过全局最优的序列。由于每一步都只选择局部最优的词，贪婪解码可能会导致生成的文本质量较低，缺乏连贯性和多样性。<br>Example
例如，在给定一个语言模型预测下一个词的任务中，如果模型在某一步预测的概率分布为：

<br>"The"：0.5
<br>"A"：0.3
<br>"An"：0.2

贪婪解码会选择概率最高的词 "The" 作为输出，然后继续这个过程，选择下一个词，直到生成完整的句子。
<br><br><br>The formula represents the confidence score  for the -th decoding path when generating the answer. The formula is as follows:<br><br>Where:<br>
<br>: Confidence score for the -th decoding path.
<br>: Normalization factor by the length of the answer.
<br>: Summation over all tokens in the answer.
<br>: Probability of the top-ranked token  at the -th decoding step.
<br>: Probability of the second-ranked token  at the -th decoding step.
<br>Here,  and  represent the top two tokens at the -th decoding step in the -th decoding path, chosen for their maximum post-softmax probabilities from the vocabulary, given  being part of the answer tokens.<br>The model’s overall confidence in decoding the final answer is approximated by averaging these probability differences for all relevant answer tokens .<br>CoT-Decoding 

<br>在生成第一个 token 时，在 n 个 token 中选择前 k个 token
<br>现在每个 token 都对应了该推理路径的起点，之后模型对每条路径都采用 Greedy Decoding 的方式生成后续的 token
<br>在生成 token 的同时，将该时刻生成的 n 个 token 里 softmax 排名最高的两个 token 概率相减，累加到该路径的置信度中
<br>最后选择置信度最高的路径作为最终的推理路径

CoT-Decoding Effectively Elicits Reasoning from Language Models
 CoT-Decoding 能有效地从语言模型引导出推理路径

<br>首先是把 CoT-Decoding 与其他解码方法进行对比 
<br>然后是测试 CoT-Decoding 在不同参数量的同一个模型影响 
<br>以及 k 值的选择对结果的影响

<br><img alt="Result" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407062132592.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>作者认为只有 CoT-decoding 方法可以有效地引导模型进行推理。<br><br>在这个实验中，作者针对不同的模型包括 Mistral-7B、PaLM-2 和 Gemma，分别采用Greedy Decoding 和 Cot Decoding 进行测试。<br><img alt="Effectively In Different Models" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407061332678.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>PaLM-2, Mistral and Gemma, all show a significant improvement in performance when using CoT-decoding compared to greedy decoding. 
针对不同的模型，采用 CoT-Decoding 方法，都能提高模型的准确性
<br><br> 在这个实验中，作者对GSM8K和Year Parity两个测试集<br>
使用不同参数的同一个模型PaLM-2进行测试<br>
<br>
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407062151542.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
CoT-decoding reliably improves reasoning performance across model scales (PaLM-2), even when the task does not naturally improve by scaling up only (e.g., year parity).<br>Quote

<br>On GSM8K, CoT Decoding consistently yields +10-30% absolute accuracy gains. 
<br>On year parity, when using greedy decoding, the model's performance remains flat even after scaling up model sizes.<br>
CoT-Decoding 在不同参数大小上的模型都能表现出甚至超过下一个参数大小模型的效果

<br><br>在下图的 Large size 和 Instruction-tuned 的两个模型测试结果上看，两者的准确率相差不大<br><img alt="closes the reasoning gap between pre-trained and instruction-tuned models" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407061345129.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Intriguingly, we observe that CoT-decoding enables a pre-trained model to achieve a similar performance of an instruction-tuned model

<br>作者还认为，CoT-Decoding 方法可以部分地缩小预训练和指导调整模型之间的推理差距，而不需要使用任何监督数据。

<br>更有趣的是，CoT-Decoding 可以优化 Instruction-tuned model<br>
<br>
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407062222490.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>More interestingly, we observe that CoT decoding can further improve the instruction tuned model<br><br>因为 CoT-Decoding 最后还是得从模型中给出的 K 条路径里选择一条推理路径<br>
所以 K 的选择会影响最终的结果	<br>在这个实验里，作者对PaLM-2 model 进行不同 K 值的测试<br><img alt="Result" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407071256543.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Quote
Overall we found that higher values of K typically result in improved model performance, suggesting that in many cases, the correct CoT paths may indeed exist but are often ranked lower during model's decoding.<br>
For instruction-tuned models, the effect of 𝑘 is less significant, indicating that the process of instruction-tuning effectively brings forth the majority of CoT-paths to the first few decoding paths.
<br>总体上看，较高的 K 值通常会导致模型性能的提高，这表明在许多情况下，正确的 CoT 路径可能确实存在，但通常在模型的贪心解码过程中排名较低。	<br>
对于指令微调的模型，K的影响较小，这表明指令调整的过程有效地将大多数 CoT 路径提到了前几个解码路径中。<br>
<br><br>作者认为 CoT-Decoding 能更好地揭露模型的内在推理能力<br>在这个实验里使用 CoT-Decoding，尝试了常见的几个推理任务<br>以下是这几个符号推理任务的解释：(来自 ChatCPT)

<br>
Coin Flip Task（抛硬币任务）：

<br>描述：这个任务来自Wei等人的研究（2022年）。在这个任务中，模型需要模拟多轮抛硬币的过程，并推断最终的结果。
<br>难度：任务难度通过潜在抛硬币轮次（2轮、3轮、4轮）来调整。每一轮抛硬币的结果（正面或反面）会影响最终的推理过程。


<br>
Web of Lies Task（谎言之网任务）：

<br>描述：这个任务来自Big-Bench-Hard基准测试，由Suzgun等人（2022年）设计。在这个任务中，模型需要解析包含若干真假声明的语句集合，并确定哪些语句是真实的，哪些是虚假的。
<br>难度：任务难度通过声明的数量（3个、4个、5个）来调整。随着声明数量的增加，推理的复杂性也随之增加。

Multi-step Arithmetic Task（多步骤算术任务）：

<br>描述：这个任务同样来自Big-Bench-Hard基准测试。在这个任务中，模型需要解决包含多个步骤的算术问题。这些问题可能涉及加法、减法、乘法、除法等基本算术运算，需要模型逐步推理出最终答案。
<br>难度：任务难度通过问题的深度（𝑑）和长度（𝑙）来调整。深度表示问题包含的步骤数量，长度表示每一步涉及的操作复杂性。随着深度和长度的增加，任务的复杂性也随之增加。

<br>We also looked at the model's top-K decoding paths, and found that models can generate the correct CoT paths when the solution involves at most 1 or 2 step knowledge manipulation, and the model starts to struggle with generating the correct CoT-paths when the steps become 3 or more.
<br>This mirrors the finding in (McCoy et al., 2023), where the authors show language models are highly influenced by the distribution they have been trained on.

<br>当解决方案涉及最多1或2步知识操作时，模型可以生成正确的 CoT 路径，但当步骤变为3或更多时，模型开始难以生成正确的 CoT 路径。作者认为这表明模型在推理方面的局限性。<br>
作者也认为这与 (McCoy et al., 2023) 的研究结果一致，他们表明语言模型受到它们训练的分布的影响。	<br>Quote

<br>On Coin-Flip and Web-of-Lies, we observe that the model can generate CoT paths that simulate the process step-by-step, but it can easily lose track of the states, especially when the task complexity increases.
<br>On Multi-step Arithmetic, we observe that the model tends to perform calculations from left to right in the CoT-decoding paths, rather than following the correct mathematical order.

<br>在 Coin-Flip 和 Web-of-Lies 任务中，我们观察到模型可以生成逐步模拟过程的 CoT 路径，但当任务复杂度增加时，模型很容易失去状态。<br>
在 Multi-step Arithmetic 任务中，我们观察到模型倾向于在 CoT-decoding 路径中从左到右进行计算，而不是按照正确的数学顺序进行计算。<br>总的来说，就是 CoT-Decoding 可以从模型里选到比较合理的推理路径，但没办法无中生有直接生成正确的推理路径<br><br>最后作者尝试把CoT-Decoding 和 CoT-Prompting 结合，发现效果会更好<br>Quote
CoT-Decoding maintains a strong performance compared to self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023a) when both are combined with CoT-prompts.
<br>CoTCoT-Decoding 与 CoT-Prompting 结合后，与 self-consistency 方法相比，性能仍然很强。<br><img alt="Combining CoT-decoding with CoT-Prompting" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407061420054.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Quote
Since self-consistency aggregates over multiple paths, we also show the performance based on our path aggregation algorithm, which significantly improves the model's reasoning at a similar cost.
<br>由于 self-consistency 聚合了多个路径，我们还展示了基于我们的路径聚合算法的性能，在成本差不多的情况下，模型的推理能力显著提高。]]></description><link>https://www.allenygy.vip/research/cot/cot-decoding.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Research/CoT/CoT-Decoding.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[AllenYGY]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:44:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407080251459.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/DeepLearning/202407080251459.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MySQL and NoSQL database comparison for IoT application]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:Database" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#Database</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:integration" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#integration</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:NoSQL" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#NoSQL</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:SQL" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#SQL</a> <a class="tag" href="https://www.allenygy.vip/?query=tag:ReadPaper" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#ReadPaper</a>

<br>What is IOT？
<br>SQL Versus NoSQL
<br>Experiment 
<br>SQL and NoSQL Integration
<br>Conclusion
<br><br>
<br>IoT refers to any object/thing around us which is connected to internet. 
<br>This object is also able to communicate through internet.
<br>Like temperature sensor connected to oven, fridge or just to measure a room temperature. IoT is network of such things which may communicate with each other or with user.<br>IoT is having application in various domains like smart city, industrial, medical services, etc.<br><br><br><br>Temperature, humidity, soil moisture sensors are used in the hardware along with the water level detection.<br>Sprinkler motor is turned ON depending on the inputs from soil moisture and water level in the tank. If the soil moisture level drops below the threshold value and if water level is TRUE, then sprinkler motor turns ON.<br><br><img alt="System Architecture" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Database/202407101124185.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>The data from these sensors is collected and is sent to database server and user email ID. The aim is to further utilize this data for analysis using data processing tools.<br>Data is stored in both MySQL and MongoDB database systems for carrying out the comparison study.<br><br><img alt="MySQL" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Database/202407101137755.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>Db.collection.insert({
	sensor_id: &lt;sensor ID number&gt;,
	Humidity: &lt;humidity sensor reading&gt;, 
	Soil_moisture: &lt;moisture sensor reading&gt;, 
	Temperature: &lt;temperature sensor reading&gt;, 
	CreateDate: new Date(), 
	Userid: &lt;User ID&gt; 
})

<br>SELECT query with varying number of threads 
<br>Here is the summary of the first two experiments from the document comparing MySQL and MongoDB databases for an IoT application:<br><br>Measure the response time of SELECT queries with varying numbers of threads.<br>
<br>Setup: The number of threads was varied from 1 to 10. Each SELECT query fetched 1000 records from a database containing 10,000 records.
<br>Results: 

<br>For up to 4 threads, the response times for MySQL and MongoDB were similar.
<br>At 10 threads, MongoDB showed a significant increase in response time compared to MySQL.
<br>Observation: Too many threads in MongoDB can overwhelm the system, leading to increased latency and CPU starvation.


<br><br>
<br>Objective: Measure the response time for INSERT queries with varying numbers of threads.
<br>Setup: Similar to the SELECT query test, the number of threads was varied from 1 to 10.
<br>Results: 

<br>The response time for MySQL increased at a faster rate compared to MongoDB.
<br>MongoDB demonstrated faster performance for INSERT operations.
<br>Observation: MongoDB outperformed MySQL in write latency, making it a better choice for applications with heavy write operations.


<br>These experiments highlight the differences in performance characteristics between MySQL and MongoDB, with MongoDB showing advantages in handling write operations under load, while MySQL maintained more stable read performance with higher thread counts.<br>
<br>INSERT query with varying number of threads 
<br>SELECT query with varying number of records 
<br>INSERT query with varying number of records
<br>Each database has its own advantages and disadvantages.<br>
<br>MongoDB showed less response time in some scenarios compared to MySQL.
<br>MySQL responses were more stable compared to MongoDB.
<br><br>
<br>SQL + X[NoSQL]

<br>Redis+MySQL As a Caching Layer for MySQL


<br>Hybrid Database

<br>MSI Architecture 


<br><br>Scenario: Improve read performance and reduce database load.<br><img alt="Redis" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Database/202407101217920.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>MySQL: Serves as the primary persistent data storage, handling complex queries and transactions.
<br>Redis: Acts as a caching layer, storing frequently accessed or common data such as user sessions and popular product information.
<br>Example:<br>
When a user requests data, the application first checks the Redis cache. If the data is found in the cache, it is returned immediately. If not, the data is fetched from MySQL, then stored in Redis for future requests. This approach reduces the load on MySQL and improves the overall response time of the application.<br>缓存层
场景：提高读性能，减少数据库负载。

<br>MySQL：作为主要的持久化数据存储，处理复杂的查询和事务。 
<br>Redis：作为缓存层，存储常用或频繁访问的数据，如用户会话、热门商品信息等。

<br><br>MSI mainly includes eight components<br>
<br>API dispatcher 
<br>SQL parser 
<br>SQL optimizer 
<br>SQL router 
<br>SQL executor 
<br>DBMS adapter 
<br>Result merger 
<br>Meta-data management
<br><img alt="MSI Architecture" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Database/202407101200521.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>The MSI's input and the result of the SQL process is the MSI's output.
<br><br>
<br>SQL and NoSQL databases offer unique sets of capabilities and advantages. 
<br>The key to successful integration lies in understanding the intrinsic properties of each database type and crafting a strategy tailored to the specific needs of the organization.

<br>两个星号 ** 表示匹配任意的中间目录中括号可以使用短中线连接

<br>[0-9]表示任意一位数字,[a-z]表示任意一位小写字母


<br>! 表示取反

<br>#忽略所有的 .a 文件
*.a
#但跟踪所有的 lib.a，即便你在前面忽略了 .a 文件
!lib.a
#只忽略当前目录下的TODO文件，而不忽略 subdir/TODO
/TODO
#忽略任何目录下名为 build 的文件夹

 <br><br><br>正则表达式是一种用于匹配和操作文本的强大工具，它是由一系列字符和特殊字符组成的模式，用于描述要匹配的文本模式。<br>正则表达式可以在文本中查找、替换、提取和验证特定的模式。<br>+&nbsp;号代表前面的字符必须至少出现一次（1次或多次）

<br>runoo+b，可以匹配&nbsp;runoob、runooob、runoooooob&nbsp;等

<br>*&nbsp;号代表前面的字符可以不出现，也可以出现一次或者多次（0次、或1次、或多次）

<br>runoo*b，可以匹配&nbsp;runob、runoob、runoooooob&nbsp;等

<br>?&nbsp;问号代表前面的字符最多只可以出现一次（0次或1次）

<br>colou?r&nbsp;可以匹配&nbsp;color&nbsp;或者&nbsp;colour

<br>构造正则表达式的方法和创建数学表达式的方法一样。也就是用多种元字符与运算符可以将小的表达式结合在一起来创建更大的表达式。正则表达式的组件可以是单个的字符、字符集合、字符范围、字符间的选择或者所有这些组件的任意组合。<br>正则表达式是由普通字符（例如字符 a 到 z）以及特殊字符（称为"元字符"）组成的文字模式。模式描述在搜索文本时要匹配的一个或多个字符串。正则表达式作为一个模板，将某个字符模式与所搜索的字符串进行匹配。<br><br>普通字符包括没有显式指定为元字符的所有可打印和不可打印字符。这包括所有大写和小写字母、所有数字、所有标点符号和一些其他符号。<br>[ ]	 匹配 [...] 中的所有字符

<br>[aeiou]&nbsp;匹配字符串 "google runoob taobao" 中所有的 e o u a 字母。

<br>[^ ] 匹配除了&nbsp;[...]&nbsp;中字符的所有字符

<br>&nbsp;[^aeiou]&nbsp;匹配字符串 "google runoob taobao" 中除了 e o u a 字母的所有字符。

<br>[A-Z] 表示一个区间，匹配所有大写字母，[a-z] 表示所有小写字母。 <br>. 匹配除换行符（\n、\r）之外的任何单个字符，相等于 [^\n\r]。<br>\w 匹配字母、数字、下划线。等价于 [A-Za-z0-9_]<br>\d 匹配任意一个阿拉伯数字（0 到 9）。等价于&nbsp;[0-9]<br><br><br><br>所谓特殊字符，就是一些有特殊含义的字符，如上面说的&nbsp;runoo*b&nbsp;中的&nbsp;*，简单的说就是表示任何字符串的意思。如果要查找字符串中的&nbsp;*&nbsp;符号，则需要对&nbsp;*&nbsp;进行转义，即在其前加一个&nbsp;\，runo\*ob&nbsp;匹配字符串&nbsp;**runo*ob**。<br>许多元字符要求在试图匹配它们时特别对待。若要匹配这些特殊字符，必须首先使字符"转义"，即，将反斜杠字符\&nbsp;放在它们前面。下表列出了正则表达式中的特殊字符：<br><br><br>限定符用来指定正则表达式的一个给定组件必须要出现多少次才能满足匹配。<br>有&nbsp;*&nbsp;或&nbsp;+&nbsp;或&nbsp;?&nbsp;或&nbsp;{n}&nbsp;或&nbsp;{n,}&nbsp;或&nbsp;{n,m}&nbsp;共6种。<br>正则表达式的限定符有：<br><br>匹配问号上面一行 ^(.*)\n\?\s*$<br>解决CSDN外链问题<br>
<br>

 <br><br>CSS
Cascading Style Sheets 层叠样式表<br>
CSS世界的诞生就是为图文信息展示服务的
<br><br><br>属性 height, weight,...<br><br>值

<br>整数值，如z-index:1中的1，属于&lt;integer&gt;，同时也属于&lt;number&gt;
<br>数值，如line-height:1.5中的1.5，属于&lt;number&gt;
<br>百分比值，如padding:50%中的50%，属于&lt;percent&gt;
<br>长度值，如99px 
<br>颜色值，如#999

<br><br>关键字：transparent

<br>泛关键字： inherit

<br><br>变量：CSS2中不多见&gt;<br><br>长度单位: px, em
百分号%不是长度单位<br>
绝对长度单位：px，还有pt, cm, mm, pc, 几乎不用<br>
相对长度单位

<br>相对字体长度单位: em,ex 还有CSS3中的rem,ch；
<br>相对视区长度单位：vh,vw,vmin,vmax；

<br><br>功能符：值以函数的形式指定（就是被括号括起来的那种）

<br>主要用来表示颜色（rgba和hsla）
<br>背景图片地址（url）
<br>元素属性值、计算（calc）和过渡效果等<br>
如rgba(0,0,0,.5)、url('css-world.png')、attr('href')和scale(-1)

<br><br>属性值：属性冒号后面的所有内容统一称为属性值。

<br>例如，1px solid rgb(0,0,0)就可以称为属性值
<br>它是由“值+关键字+功能符”构成的。属性值也可以由单一内容构成。
<br>例如，z-index:1的1也是属性值。

<br><br>声明： 属性名加上属性值就是声明
例如：
color: transparent;

<br><br>声明块： 声明块是花括号（{}）包裹的一系列声明
例如：
{
　 height: 99px;
　 color: transparent;
}

<br><br>规则或规则集: 出现了选择器，而且后面还跟着声明块
例如：
.vocabulary {
　 height: 99px;
　 color: transparent;
}

<br><br>选择器： 选择器是用来瞄准目标元素的东西<br>
<br>
类选择器：指以“.”这个点号开头的选择器。
很多元素可以应用同一个类选择器。
“类”，天生就是被公用的命。



<br>
ID选择器：“#”打头，权重相当高。ID一般指向唯一元素。
但是，在CSS中，ID样式出现在多个不同的元素上并不会只渲染第一个，而是雨露均沾。但显然不推荐这么做。


<br>
属性选择器：指含有[]的选择器

<br>
伪类选择器：一般指前面有个英文冒号（:）的选择器
如:first-child 或:last-child等。


<br>
伪元素选择器：就是有连续两个冒号的选择器
如::first-line::first-letter、::before和::after。


<br><br>关系选择器：关系选择器是指根据与其他元素的关系选择元素的选择器
常见的符号有空格、&gt;、~，还有+等，这些都是非常常用的选择器。
<br>
<br>
后代选择器：选择所有合乎规则的后代元素。空格连接。

<br>
相邻后代选择器：仅仅选择合乎规则的儿子元素，孙子、重孙元素忽略，因此又称“子选择器”。
&gt;连接。适用于IE7以上版本。


<br>
兄弟选择器：选择当前元素后面的所有合乎规则的兄弟元素。
~连接。适用于IE7以上版本。


<br>
相邻兄弟选择器：仅仅选择当前元素相邻的那个合乎规则的兄弟元素。
+连接。适用于IE7以上版本。


<br><br>@规则: @规则指的是以@字符开始的一些规则
例如： @media、@font-face、@page或者@support，诸如此类。

 <br><br><br>
<br>ES6语法规范
<br>ES6模块化
<br>包管理器
<br>原型、原型链
<br>数组常用方法
<br>axios
<br>promise
<br><br>
<br>想让Vue工作，就必须创建一个Vue实例，且要传入一个配置对象；
<br>root容器里的代码依然符合html规范，只不过混入了一些特外的Vue语法；
<br>容器里的代码破称为【Vue模板】;
<br>容器与实例一一对应；
<br>真实开发中只有一个Vue实例，并且会配合着组件一起使用；
<br>｛｛xxx｝｝中的xxx要写js表达式，且xxx可以自动读取到data中的所有属性；
<br>一且data中的数据发生改变，那么模板中用到该数据的地方也会自动更新；
<br><br>Vue模板语法有2大类：<br>
<br>插值语法：

<br>功能：“用于解析标签体内容。
<br>写法：｛｛xxx｝｝，xxx是js表达式，且可以直接读取到data中的所有属性。


<br>指令语法：

<br>功能：用于解析标签（包括：标签属性、标签体内容、绑定事件..•.）。
<br>举例：v-bind:href="xoox"或简写为：href="xxx"，xoxcx同样要写js表达式，且可以直接读取到data中的所有属性。


<br><a href="https://www.allenygy.vip?query=tag:备注" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#备注</a>
Vue中有很多的指令，且形式都是：V-2？？？，此处我们只是拿v-bind举个例子。 
<br><br>Vue中有2种数据绑定的方式：<br>
<br>单向绑定（v-bind）：数据只能从data流向页面。
<br>双向绑定（Y-model）：数据不仅能从data流向页面，还可以从页面流间data。
<a href="https://www.allenygy.vip?query=tag:备注" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#备注</a>

<br>双向绑定一股都应用在表单类元素上（如：input、select等）
<br>v-model:value 可以简写为 v-model，因为v-model默认收集的就是value值。



<br><br>
<br>el有2种写法

<br>new Vue时候h置e1属性。
<br>先创建Ve刻例，随后再通过vm.$mount('#root')指定el的值。


<br>data有2种写法

<br>对象式
<br>函数式
<a href="https://www.allenygy.vip?query=tag:备注" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#备注</a>
data必须使用函数式，否则会报错。 




<br>一个重要的原则：<br>
由vue管理的函数，一定不要写箭头函数，一旦写了箭头函数，this就不再是Vue实例了。
<br><br>
<br>M: 模型(Model): 对应data中的数据
<br>V: 视图(View): 模版
<br>VM: 视图模型(ViewModel): Vue实例对象<br>
<img alt="MVVC" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/Vue/MVVC.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>观察发现：<br>
<br>data中所有的属性，最后都出现在了vm身上。
<br>vm身上所有的属性 及 Vue原型上所有属性，在Vue模板中都可以直接使用。
<br><br>数据代理：通过一个对象代理对另一个对象中属性的操作（读/写）<br>
<br>
Vue中的数据代理
通过vm对象来代理data对象中属性的操作（读/写）


<br>
Vue中数据代理的好处
更加方便的操作data中的数据


<br>
基本原理
通过Object.defineProperty（）把data对象中所有属性添加到vm上。<br>
为每一个添加到vm上的属性，都指定一个getter/setter。<br>
在getter/Fetter内部去採作（读/写）data中对应的属性。


<br><br><br>
<br>使用v-on:xxx 或 @xxx 绑定事件，其中xxx是事件名；
<br>事件的回调需要配置在methods对象中，最终会在vm上；
<br>methods中配置的函数，不要用箭头函数！否则this就不是vm了；
<br>methods中配置的函数，都是被Vue所管理的函数，this的指向是vm 或 组件实例对象；
<br>@click="demo" 和 @click="demo($event)" 效果一致，但后者可以传参；
<br><br>
<br>prevent：阻止默认事件
<br>stop：阻止事件冒泡
<br>once：事件只触发一次
<br>capture：使用事件的捕获模式
<br>self：只有event.target是当前操作的元素时才触发事件
<br>passive：事件的默认行为立即执行，无需等待事件回调执行完毕
<br><br>
<br>Vue中常用的按键别名：

<br>回车 =&gt; enter
<br>删除 =&gt; delete (捕获“删除”和“退格”键)
<br>退出 =&gt; esc
<br>空格 =&gt; space
<br>换行 =&gt; tab (特殊，必须配合keydown去使用)
<br>上 =&gt; up
<br>下 =&gt; down
<br>左 =&gt; left
<br>右 =&gt; right


<br>Vue未提供别名的按键，可以使用按键原始的key值去绑定，但注意要转为kebab-case（短横线命名）
<br>系统修饰键（用法特殊）：ctrl、alt、shift、meta

<br>配合keyup使用：按下修饰键的同时，再按下其他键，随后释放其他键，事件才被触发。
<br>配合keydown使用：正常触发事件。  


<br>也可以使用keyCode去指定具体的按键（不推荐）
<br>Vue.config.keyCodes.自定义键名 = 键码，可以去定制按键别名
<br><br>
<br>定义：要用的属性不存在，要通过已有属性计算得来。
<br>原理：底层借助了Objcet.defineproperty方法提供的getter和setter。
<br>get函数什么时候执行？
Answer

<br>初次读取时会执行一次。
<br>当依赖的数据发生改变时会被再次调用。



<br>优势：与methods实现相比，内部有缓存机制（复用），效率更高，调试方便。
Note

<br>计算属性最终会出现在vm上，直接读取使用即可。
<br>如果计算属性要被修改，那必须写set函数去响应修改，且set中要引起计算时依赖的数据发生改变。



<br><br><br>
<br>当被监视的属性变化时, 回调函数自动调用, 进行相关操作
<br>监视的属性必须存在，才能进行监视！！
<br>监视的两种写法：

<br>new Vue时传入watch配置
<br>通过vm.$watch监视


<br><br>
<br>Vue中的watch默认不监测对象内部值的改变（一层）。
<br>配置deep:true可以监测对象内部值改变（多层）。
备注：

<br>Vue自身可以监测对象内部值的改变，但Vue提供的watch默认不可以！
<br>使用watch时根据数据的具体结构，决定是否采用深度监视。



<br>Computed Vs Watch
computed和watch之间的区别：

<br>computed能完成的功能，watch都可以完成。
<br>watch能完成的功能，computed不一定能完成，例如：watch可以进行异步操作。

<br>两个重要的小原则：

<br>所被Vue管理的函数，最好写成普通函数，这样this的指向才是vm 或 组件实例对象。
<br>所有不被Vue所管理的函数（定时器的回调函数、ajax的回调函数等、Promise的回调函数），最好写成箭头函数，<br>
这样this的指向才是vm 或 组件实例对象。

<br><br>
<br>class样式<br>
写法:class="xxx" xxx可以是字符串、对象、数组。<br>
字符串写法适用于：类名不确定，要动态获取。<br>
对象写法适用于：要绑定多个样式，个数不确定，名字也不确定。<br>
数组写法适用于：要绑定多个样式，个数确定，名字也确定，但不确定用不用。
<br>style样式
<br>:style="{fontSize: xxx}"其中xxx是动态值。
:style="[a,b]"其中a、b是样式对象。
<br><br><br>写法：<br>
<br>v-if="表达式"
<br>v-else-if="表达式"
<br>v-else="表达式"
Feature
适用于：切换频率较低的场景。<br>
特点：不展示的DOM元素直接被移除。<br>
注意：v-if可以和:v-else-if、v-else一起使用，但要求结构不能被“打断”。


<br><br>Feature
写法：v-show="表达式"<br>
适用于：切换频率较高的场景。<br>
特点：不展示的DOM元素未被移除，仅仅是使用样式隐藏掉
<br>备注：
使用v-if的时，元素可能无法获取到，而使用v-show一定可以获取到。
<br><br><br>v-for

<br>用于展示列表数据
<br>语法：v-for="(item, index) in xxx" :key="yyy"
<br>可遍历：数组、对象、字符串（用的很少）、指定次数（用的很少）

<br>&lt;div id="root"&gt;

&lt;!-- 遍历数组 --&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;人员列表（遍历数组）&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li v-for="(p,index) of persons" :key="index"&gt;
			{{p.name}}-{{p.age}}
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- 遍历对象 --&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;汽车信息（遍历对象）&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    	&lt;li v-for="(value,k) of car" :key="k"&gt;
    		{{k}}-{{value}}
    	&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- 遍历字符串 --&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;测试遍历字符串（用得少）&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
    		&lt;li v-for="(char,index) of str" :key="index"&gt;
    			{{char}}-{{index}}
    		&lt;/li&gt;
    	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- 遍历指定次数 --&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;测试遍历指定次数（用得少）&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li v-for="(number,index) of 5" :key="index"&gt;
				{{index}}-{{number}}
			&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
<br><br>
<br>虚拟DOM中key的作用：

<br>key是虚拟DOM对象的标识，当数据发生变化时，Vue会根据【新数据】生成【新的虚拟DOM】
<br>随后Vue进行【新虚拟DOM】与【旧虚拟DOM】的差异比较，比较规则如下：


<br>对比规则：

<br>旧虚拟DOM中找到了与新虚拟DOM相同的key：

<br>若虚拟DOM中内容没变, 直接使用之前的真实DOM！
<br>若虚拟DOM中内容变了, 则生成新的真实DOM，随后替换掉页面中之前的真实DOM。


<br>旧虚拟DOM中未找到与新虚拟DOM相同的key

<br>创建新的真实DOM，随后渲染到到页面。




<br>用index作为key可能会引发的问题：

<br>若对数据进行：逆序添加、逆序删除等破坏顺序操作:<br>
会产生没有必要的真实DOM更新 ==&gt; 界面效果没问题, 但效率低。
<br>如果结构中还包含输入类的DOM：<br>
会产生错误DOM更新 ==&gt; 界面有问题。


<br>开发中如何选择key?

<br>最好使用每条数据的唯一标识作为key, 比如id、手机号、身份证号、学号等唯一值。
<br>如果不存在对数据的逆序添加、逆序删除等破坏顺序操作，仅用于渲染列表用于展示，使用index作为key是没有问题的。


<br><br>
<br>Vue会监视data中所有层次的数据。
<br>
如何监测对象中的数据?
   通过setter实现监视，且要在new Vue时就传入要监测的数据。

<br>对象中后追加的属性，Vue默认不做响应式处理
<br>如需给后添加的属性做响应式，请使用如下API：<br>
Vue.set(target，propertyName/index，value) 或<br>
vm.$set(target，propertyName/index，value)



<br>
如何监测数组中的数据？
通过包裹数组更新元素的方法实现，本质就是做了两件事：

<br>调用原生对应的方法对数组进行更新。
<br>重新解析模板，进而更新页面。



<br>
 在Vue修改数组中的某个元素一定要用如下方法：

<br>使用这些API:push()、pop()、shift()、unshift()、splice()、sort()、reverse()
<br>Vue.set() 或 vm.$set()



<br>特别注意
Vue.set() 和 vm.$set() 不能给vm 或 vm的根数据对象 添加属性！！！
<br><br><br>&lt;input type="text"/&gt;
<br>则v-model收集的是value值，用户输入的就是value值。<br><br>&lt;input type="radio"/&gt;
<br>则v-model收集的是value值，且要给标签配置value值。<br><br>&lt;input type="checkbox"/&gt;
<br>
<br>没有配置input的value属性，那么收集的就是checked（勾选 or 未勾选，是布尔值）
<br>配置input的value属性:

<br>v-model的初始值是非数组，那么收集的就是checked（勾选 or 未勾选，是布尔值）
<br>v-model的初始值是数组，那么收集的的就是value组成的数组


<br>v-model的三个修饰符
lazy：失去焦点再收集数据<br>
number：输入字符串转为有效的数字<br>
trim：输入首尾空格过滤
<br><br>定义：
对要显示的数据进行特定格式化后再显示（适用于一些简单逻辑的处理）。
<br>语法:

<br>注册过滤器：Vue.filter(name,callback) 或 new Vue{filters:{}} 
<br>使用过滤器：{{ xxx | 过滤器名}} 或 v-bind:属性 = "xxx | 过滤器名"

<br>备注：

<br>过滤器也可以接收额外参数、多个过滤器也可以串联
<br>并没有改变原本的数据, 是产生新的对应的数据

<br><br>Abstract
v-bind : 单向绑定解析表达式, 可简写为 :xxx<br>
v-model : 双向数据绑定<br>
v-for : 遍历数组/对象/字符串<br>
v-on : 绑定事件监听, 可简写为@<br>
v-if : 条件渲染（动态控制节点是否存存在）<br>
v-else : 条件渲染（动态控制节点是否存存在）<br>
v-show : 条件渲染 (动态控制节点是否展示)
<br>v-text指令

<br>作用：向其所在的节点中渲染文本内容。 
<br>与插值语法的区别：v-text会替换掉节点中的内容，{{xx}}则不会。

<br>v-html指令

<br>作用：向指定节点中渲染包含html结构的内容。
<br>与插值语法的区别：

<br>v-html会替换掉节点中所有的内容，{{xx}}则不会。
<br>v-html可以识别html结构。



<br>v-html有安全性问题！！！！

<br>在网站上动态渲染任意HTML是非常危险的，容易导致XSS攻击。
<br>一定要在可信的内容上使用v-html，永不要用在用户提交的内容上！

<br>v-cloak指令（没有值）

<br>本质是一个特殊属性，Vue实例创建完毕并接管容器后，会删掉v-cloak属性。
<br>使用css配合v-cloak可以解决网速慢时页面展示出{{xxx}}的问题。

<br>
&lt;style&gt;
	[v-cloak]{
		display:none;
	}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div id="root"&gt;
	&lt;h2 v-cloak&gt;{{name}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<br>v-once指令

<br>v-once所在节点在初次动态渲染后，就视为静态内容了。
<br>以后数据的改变不会引起v-once所在结构的更新，可以用于优化性能。

<br>v-pre指令：

<br>跳过其所在节点的编译过程。
<br>可利用它跳过：没有使用指令语法、没有使用插值语法的节点，会加快编译。

<br><br><br>
<br>局部指令
<br>new Vue({ 
	directives:{指令名：配置对象}
})

new Vue({ 
	directives:{指令名：回调函数}
})
<br>
<br>全局指令
<br>Vue.directive(指令名,配置对象) 
Vue.directive(指令名,回调函数)
<br><br>
<br>bind：指令与元素成功绑定时调用。
<br>inserted：指令所在元素被插入页面时调用。
<br>update：指令所在模板结构被重新解析时调用。
<br>备注

<br>指令定义时不加v-，但使用时要加v-；
<br>指令名如果是多个单词，要使用kebab-case命名方式，不要用camelCase命名。

<br><br>生命周期

<br>又名：生命周期回调函数、生命周期函数、生命周期钩子。<br>
2.是什么：Vue在关键时刻帮我们调用的一些特殊名称的函数。<br>
3.生命周期函数的名字不可更改，但函数的具体内容是程序员根据需求编写的。<br>
4.生命周期函数中的this指向是vm 或 组件实例对象。

<br><img alt="生命周期" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@master/IMAGE/vue/LifeCycle.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>常用的生命周期钩子

<br>mounted: 发送ajax请求、启动定时器、绑定自定义事件、订阅消息等.<br>
【初始化操作】
<br>beforeDestroy: 清除定时器、解绑自定义事件、取消订阅消息等.<br>
【收尾工作】

<br>关于销毁Vue实例
1.销毁后借助Vue开发者工具看不到任何信息。<br>
2.销毁后自定义事件会失效，但原生DOM事件依然有效。<br>
3.一般不会在beforeDestroy操作数据，因为即便操作数据，也不会再触发更新流程了。
<br><br><br>
<br>定义组件(创建组件)
<br>注册组件
<br>使用组件(写组件标签)
<br>如何定义一个组件？
使用Vue.extend(options)创建，其中options和new Vue(options)时传入的那个options几乎一样，但也有点区别；
<br>区别如下：<br>
<br>el不要写，为什么？ ——— 最终所有的组件都要经过一个vm的管理，由vm中的el决定服务哪个容器。
<br>data必须写成函数，为什么？ ———— 避免组件被复用时，数据存在引用关系。
<br>使用template可以配置组件结构。<br>如何注册组件？

<br>局部注册：靠new Vue的时候传入components选项
<br>全局注册：靠Vue.component('组件名',组件)

<br>编写组件标签：
&lt;school&gt;&lt;/school&gt;

<br>几个注意点<br>
<br>
关于组件名:<br>
- 一个单词组成：<br>
第一种写法(首字母小写)：school<br>
第二种写法(首字母大写)：School<br>
- 多个单词组成：<br>
第一种写法(kebab-case命名)：my-school<br>
第二种写法(CamelCase命名)：MySchool (需要Vue脚手架支持)
 注意

<br>组件名尽可能回避HTML中已有的元素名称，例如：h2、H2都不行。
<br>可以使用name配置项指定组件在开发者工具中呈现的名字。



<br>
关于组件标签:

<br>第一种写法:
&lt;school&gt;&lt;/school&gt;


<br>第二种写法：
      &lt;school/&gt;




<br>注意
不用使用脚手架时，会导致后续组件不能渲染。
<br>
<br>一个简写方式：
<br>const school = Vue.extend(options) 
//可简写为：
const school = options
<br><br>
<br>school组件本质是一个名为VueComponent的构造函数，且不是程序员定义的，是Vue.extend生成的。
<br>我们只需要写或&lt;school&gt;&lt;/school&gt;，Vue解析时会帮我们创建school组件的实例对象，<br>
即Vue帮我们执行的：new VueComponent(options)。
<br>特别注意：每次调用Vue.extend，返回的都是一个全新的VueComponent！
<br>关于this指向：

<br>组件配置中：<br>
data函数、methods中的函数、watch中的函数、computed中的函数 它们的this均是【VueComponent实例对象】。
<br>new Vue(options)配置中：<br>
data函数、methods中的函数、watch中的函数、computed中的函数 它们的this均是【Vue实例对象】。


<br>VueComponent的实例对象，以后简称vc（也可称之为：组件实例对象）。<br>
Vue的实例对象，以后简称vm。
<br> 一个重要的内置关系
VueComponent.prototype.proto === Vue.prototype
<br>为什么要有这个关系
让组件实例对象（vc）可以访问到 Vue原型上的属性、方法。

<br><br>vue.js与vue.runtime.xxx.js的区别：

<br>vue.js是完整版的Vue，包含：核心功能+模板解析器。
<br>vue.runtime.xxx.js是运行版的Vue，只包含：核心功能；没有模板解析器。

<br>Tip
vue.runtime.xxx.js没有模板解析器，所以不能使用template配置项，需要使用 render函数接收到的createElement函数去指定具体内容。
